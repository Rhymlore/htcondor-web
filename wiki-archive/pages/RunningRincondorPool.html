   Running R in a HTCondor Pool
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  It works very well to move the R runtime in either Windows
or Linux with the job. Then one actually runs a wrapper script
to set up the runtime and place things as needed. The only
moderately tricky part is handling non-included R Packages.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the commands are the same in both a Wiindows R
developement location(One where a matching RTools is installed
and R was built using those tools) the environment settings
to have a local Package store found is a bit different.
 </p>
 <p>
  I make sure that the directory RR/library exists and then I
run this command and tar up the RR directory afRLIBSter:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <pre>  R CMD INSTALL --preclean -l ./RR/library package.tar.gx
  tar -zcvf RLIBS.tar.gz RR
</pre>
 <p>
  With windows I ship cygwin tools for tar and gzip and associated
DLLs so there is some similarity between extractions by the
wrapper scripts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Under Linux using perl I drop R into current directory
and set these two things:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <pre>  $ENV{R_HOME} = "$Rlocation";
  $ENV{LD_LIBRARY_PATH} = "$Rlocation/lib";
</pre>
 <p>
  If there is a library tar ball as mentioned above, the following
is done:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <pre>  # do we have prebuilt libraries?
  my $renviron;
  if(-f "RLIBS.tar.gz") {
    system("tar -zxvf RLIBS.tar.gz");
    $ENV{HOME} = $location;
    $renviron = "$location/.Renviron";
    open(RLIB,"&gt;$renviron") or die "Can not create &lt;$renviron&gt;:$!\n";
    print RLIB "R_LIBS_USER=$location/RR/library\n";
    close(RLIB);
  }
</pre>
 <p>
  Once that is done, the following starts R:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <pre>  $cmdtorun = "$Rlocation/bin/Rscript --no-save ./$scripts $realarg";
  print "about to execute &lt;&lt;$cmdtorun&gt;&gt;\n";
  $res = system("$cmdtorun");
</pre>
 <p>
  Windows is similar but wrapper is a .bat script. Here is what
we use in the Center for High Throughput Computing for
packages, shared files for sets up jobs, job specific input,
the runtime etc.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <pre>  dir
  time /t
  if not exist built-win32-R-2.10.1.tar.gz goto noruntime
  set R_LIBS_USER=RLIBS
  tar.exe -zxvf built-win32-R-2.10.1.tar.gz
  if not exist RLIBS.tar.gz goto nolibs
  tar.exe -zxvf RLIBS.tar.gz
  set R_LIBS_USER=RLIBS
  :nolibs
  if not exist %2.tar.gz goto nojobfiles
  tar -xvf %2.tar
  :nojobfiles
  if not exist sharedfiles.tar.gz goto nosharedfiles
  tar -zxvf sharedfiles.tar.gz
  :nosharedfiles
  mkdir tmp
  set PATH=%path%;.\bin
  dir
  dir .\bin
  echo Try job now
  Rscript.exe soartest.R
  dir
  echo Job completed
  :noruntime
  echo Failed to find runtime. This is bad!</pre>
