 If you have a HTCondor pool that is
 <strong>
  not
 </strong>
 configured to use Partitionable slots and you wish to run Folding@home as backfill jobs on those slots using the recipe
 <span class="wiki">
  <a "HowToConfigureFoldingAtHome" title="How To Configure Folding At Home">

 <h4>
  Strategy
 </h4>
 We will use HTCondor's "fetch work" configuration to run a script on each execute machine that periodically generates a job classad for Folding@Home work.  Those jobs will have a retirement time of 0 so that they can be pre-empted by jobs sent from a Schedd.  These jobs will all be run by a dedicated user named
 <strong>
  backfill
 </strong>
 , and the Startd will give negative RANK jobs from the
 <strong>
  backfill
 </strong>
 user.
 <p>
  The configuration fragment below can be customized by modifying
  <code>
   FAH_Owner
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   FAH_HOME
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   FAH_Executable
  </code>
  configuration variables near the top of the file.
