 The term "
 <span class="quote">
  WikiWiki
 </span>
 "
("wiki wiki" means "quick" in the Hawaiian language and
is pronounced "wickee wickee") can be used to identify either a
type of hypertext document or the software used to write it.
Often called "wiki" for short, the collaborative software application
enables web documents to be authored collectively using a simple markup
scheme and without the content being reviewed prior to its acceptance.
The resulting collaborative hypertext document, also called either "wiki"
or "
 <span class="quote">
  WikiWikiWeb
 </span>
 ," is typically produced by a community of users.
Many wikis (including this one) are easily identified by their use of
 <span class="wiki">
  <a href="wiki-archiveCamelCase" title="Camel Case">
   CamelCase
  </a>
 </span>
 hyperlinks.
 <p>
  The original
  <span class="quote">
   WikiWikiWeb
  </span>
  was established in 1995 by Ward Cunningham,
who invented and named the Wiki concept and produced the first
implementation of a
  <span class="quote">
   WikiWiki
  </span>
  server.  Ward's server is still online
at
  <a class="external" href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki">
   http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki
  </a>
  .  Visit that server for additional
information.  Or read a book Ward (and Bo Leuf) wrote on the concept:
  <em>
   The Wiki Way: Quick collaboration on the Web
  </em>
  , Addison-Wesley,
ISBN-020171499X.
Some people maintain that only Ward's wiki should be called "Wiki"
(upper case) or the "
  <span class="quote">
   WikiWikiWeb
  </span>
  ".
