   How to adjust the job's environment for the execute machine
  </h2>
 </span>
 <p>
  Known to work with HTCondor version: 7.0
 </p>
 <p>
  If you simply need to insert an environment variable, you can do that by putting the following in your configuration file on the execute machine:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">STARTER_JOB_ENVIRONMENT = "APP1_PATH=/opt/app1 APP2_PATH=/opt/app2"
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  If you need to dynamically modify an environment variable, you can do that in a wrapper script around the job.  Here is what you would put in the configuration file:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">USER_JOB_WRAPPER=/path/to/condor_job_wrapper
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  Then you would create a file named condor_job_wrapper (or whatever name you choose), make it executable, and put in something like the following:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">#!/bin/sh

# insert /s/std/bin into the PATH
export PATH=/s/std/bin:$PATH

exec "$@"
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  Another way for information from the machine to enter the job environment is to publish the information in the machine
  <span class="quote">
   ClassAd
  </span>
  and leave it up to the user to insert it into the job's environment via the $$() mechanism, which substitutes in values from the target
  <span class="quote">
   ClassAd
  </span>
  .  Example machine configuration:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">APP1_PATH = "/opt/app1"
APP2_PATH = "/opt/app2"
STARTD_ATTRS = $(STARTD_ATTRS) APP1_PATH APP2_PATH
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  Then the user can insert this information into the job environment by putting the following in the job submit file:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">environment = "APP1_PATH=$$(APP1_PATH) APP2_PATH=$$(APP2_PATH)"
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  If it is expected that the job may run on machines where these attributes of the machine
  <span class="quote">
   ClassAd
  </span>
  are not defined, a default value should be specified like this.  For example, if it should just be empty when undefined, use this:
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">APP1_PATH=$$(APP1_PATH:)</pre>
 </div>
</div>
