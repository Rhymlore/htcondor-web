<div id="content">
 HTCondor is available as a native package in Debian. Currently, HTCondor 7.8.2 is in
 <code>
  testing
 </code>
 , which will become the next stable release, Debian 7 (
 <code>
  wheezy
 </code>
 ). More recent versions of HTCondor are available in
 <code>
  unstable
 </code>
 (a.k.a.
 <code>
  sid
 </code>
 ).
 <p>
  Note: The HTCondor Team releases Debian packages of HTCondor that closely resemble the tarball packages. This page does not describe those packages.
 </p>
 <p>
  Michael Hanke is the current maintainer of the Debian package for HTCondor. The mailing list address condor-debian&lt;at&gt;cs.wisc.edu is also listed as a maintainer.
 </p>
 <p>
  The source tree used to create the Debian package lives on its own branch, which adds a
  <code>
   debian
  </code>
  directory and removes some files that shouldn't be in a Debian package. Merges from the HTCondor release branches are done as required when making a new release.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the HTCondor git repository, branch
  <code>
   debian
  </code>
  contains the most recent Debian package for HTCondor (7.8.4 as of this writing). It is also stored in the git repository
  <a class="external" href="http://git.debian.org/git/pkg-exppsy/condor.git">
   http://git.debian.org/git/pkg-exppsy/condor.git
  </a>
  , on the
  <code>
   master
  </code>
  branch. In that repository, branch
  <code>
   maint-wheezy
  </code>
  contains the source for versions in
  <code>
   testing
  </code>
  (a.k.a.
  <code>
   wheezy
  </code>
  ), which is 7.8.2 plus back-ported security patches. Some of the Debian package releases are tagged in both repositories with names like
  <code>
   debian/7.8.2_dfsg.1-2
  </code>
  .

 <h2>
  Upload Process
 </h2>
 <p>
  The following procedure was written originally by Michael Hanke (November 2012) and was posted here (and edited for web readability) by Tim Cartwright.
 </p>
 <p>
  Note: This was a least-effort upgrade, so you can use this as a reference for the minimum procedure. I am using the version for the current stable release in the commands:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   First, merge the release tag into the Debian "upstream" tracking branch, which is used to generate the "orig" tarball:
   <div class="verbatim">
    <pre>$ git co upstream
$ git merge V7_8_6</pre>
   </div>
  </li>
  <li>
   Now, merge it into the Debian release branch, "master" in Michael's case, and probably different for you:
   <div class="verbatim">
    <pre>$ git co master
$ git merge upstream</pre>
   </div>
  </li>
  <li>
   Generate the release tarball. This command will figure out the most recent merge point from "upstream" and describe it in terms of HTCondor release tags to generate a package version. The tarball is created in the current directory but must be moved one level up.
   <div class="verbatim">
    <pre>$ make -f debian/rules get-orig-source
$ mv condor_7.8.6\~dfsg.1.orig.tar.gz ..</pre>
   </div>
  </li>
  <li>
   Test all patches and resolve any conflicts or fuzz:
   <div class="verbatim">
    <pre>$ quilt push -a
$ quilt pop -a</pre>
   </div>
  </li>
  <li>
   Create a new changelog entry using the determined version, plus package revision. This includes creating a summary of the upstream changelog, with all the bits that are relevant for a Debian administrator or user. There are tools in Debian that will auto-generate install reports, which include the changelog entries; this is very useful for a cluster administrator, and we want to be friends...
   <div class="verbatim">
    <pre>$ dch -v '7.8.6~dfsg.1-1'</pre>
   </div>
  </li>
  <li>
   [Optional:] Set up ccache to facilitate the build:
   <div class="verbatim">
    <pre>$ export PATH=/usr/lib/ccache:$PATH</pre>
   </div>
  </li>
  <li>
   Build the package:
   <div class="verbatim">
    <pre>$ dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc</pre>
   </div>
  </li>
  <li>
   Run the package tests
   <div class="verbatim">
    <pre>$ lintian -iv ../condor_7.8.6\~dfsg.1-1_i386.changes</pre>
   </div>
  </li>
  <li>
   Deal with discovered problems
  </li>
  <li>
   Install and test the build
...
  </li>
  <li>
   When everything is ready, create a signed tag:
   <div class="verbatim">
    <pre>$ git tag -s debian/7.8.6~dfsg.1-1</pre>
   </div>
  </li>
  <li>
   Call for a Debian developer and ask for a sponsored upload
  </li>
 </ol>
</div>
