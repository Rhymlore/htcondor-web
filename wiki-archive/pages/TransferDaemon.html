 The TransferD is a feature set of HTCondor which has not yet reached production
and is barely in alpha. It implements both privilege separation of services,
decentralization of job sandbox movement, and management of I/O related to
sand box movement. The last one, however, is the most underdeveloped and is related to converted the TDMan object described in the pages below to be its own
