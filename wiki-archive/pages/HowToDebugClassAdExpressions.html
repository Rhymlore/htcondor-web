   How to Debug Complicated Class Ad expressions

 <p>
  Known to work with HTCondor version: 7.7.0 and later, and 7.5.6 and earlier.
 </p>
 <p>
  The HTCondor
  <span class="wiki">
   <a class="missing" href="wiki-archiveClassAd" title="Class Ad">
    ClassAd
   </a>
  </span>
  system is a powerful mechanism to describe policy and behavior.  However, sometimes, debugging a complicated classad expression can be difficult, especially if the expression evaluates to UNDEFINED, for no obvious reason.  The
  <span class="wiki">
   <a class="missing" href="wiki-archiveClassAd" title="Class Ad">
    ClassAd
   </a>
  </span>
  builtin function "debug" is handy in this case.  Debug is a
  <span class="wiki">
   <a class="missing" href="wiki-archiveClassAd" title="Class Ad">
    ClassAd
   </a>
  </span>
  function which takes another classad function as an argument, evaluates it, and returns it.  That is, wrapping any classad expression with debug() makes no changes whatsoever to that expression's semantics.  What does change, though, is that if the daemon that evaluates that expression has D_FULLDEBUG on, informatino about the evaluation of that one classad expression is logged to that daemon's log file.

 <p>
  For example, consider a submit file with the requirements line
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">requirements = OPSYS == "LINUX" &amp;&amp; ARCH == "X86_64" &amp;&amp; DaemonStartTime &gt; 100
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  For some reason, this job doesn't match, and condor_q -better-analyze isn't too helpful.  By changing the requirements to
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">requirements = debug(OPSYS == "LINUX" &amp;&amp; ARCH == "X86_64" &amp;&amp; DaemonStartTime &gt; 100)
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  And adding D_FULLDEBUG to the startd, the startd log shows:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">06/07/11 13:30:19 Classad debug: OPSYS --&gt; LINUX
06/07/11 13:30:19 Classad debug: ARCH --&gt; X86_64
06/07/11 13:30:19 Classad debug: DaemonStartTime --&gt; UNDEFINED
06/07/11 13:30:19 Classad debug: OPSYS == "LINUX" &amp;&amp; ARCH == "X86_64" &amp;&amp; DaemonStartTime &gt; 100 --&gt; UNDEFINED

</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  Aha!  Looks like the version of the machine ad inside the startd doesn't have
  <span class="wiki">
   <a class="missing" href="wiki-archiveDaemonStartTime" title="Daemon Start Time">
    DaemonStartTime
   </a>
  </span>
  set, even though condor_status -l shows that it is there.  Hmm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Note that Debug() is also useful for policy expressions in the config file, such as the START expression, or the various expressions inside the negotiator.
