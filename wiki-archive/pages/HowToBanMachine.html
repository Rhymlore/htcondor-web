   How to ban a machine from executing jobs

 <p>
  Known to work with HTCondor version: 7.0
 </p>
 <p>
  Suppose jobs are mysteriously failing on a particular machine. Some kind of hardware problem such as memory corruptionis suspected. It is probably a good idea to turn HTCondor off until the problem is solved. In addition, just so no mistakes are made, it may also a good idea to take the machine out of the HTCondor pool, in case HTCondor gets restarted prematurely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Do this by adding to the HTCondor configuration visible to the condor_collector daemon:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code"># 2008-04-27: badmachine has a hardware problem, so temporarily blacklist it
HOSTDENY_WRITE = $(HOSTDENY_WRITE) badmachine.domain.name
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  Issue the command
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">condor_reconfig -full</pre>
 </div>
 The existing machine
 <span class="wiki">

  </a>
 </span>
 will take time to expire (~15 minutes); restart the condor_collector daemon if the expiration interval is too long to wait.
