# Do NOT start a personal condor.  That will break the test suite.

# Arguably, those tests should be fixed so that this isn't necessary.

# The cmr-* series of tests are broken, still working on a simple fix.
# Also, the built-in Perl module for determining FQDNs is broken; you
# may need to edit /etc/resolv.conf's domain and search lines if a test
# fails because your host's FQDN is misresolved.  We should probably fix
# this problem, too.

#
# This will take /forever/.

  On a brand-new a RH7.6 VM, you'll need to do the following:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">$ sudo su
# Follow part of the install-from-repo instructions.
$ yum install wget
$ wget https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-HTCondor
$ rpm --import RPM-GPG-KEY-HTCondor
$ cd /etc/yum.repos.d
$ wget https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/yum/repo.d/htcondor-stable-rhel7.repo
# The condor build deps are broken, so I faked it.  (Install all the packages
# listed before the erroneous ones, install 'bison' instead of 'bison-devel'.)
$ yum-builddep condor
$ yum install git
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  Add the following to the CMake line:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">-DWITH_MUNGE:BOOL=FALSE -DWITH_GLOBUS:BOOL=FALSE
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  HTCondor will build without cgroups, because
  <span class="wiki">
   <a class="missing" href="wiki-archiveRedHat" title="Red Hat">
    RedHat
   </a>
  </span>
  deprecated libcgroup, which apparently means removing its -devel package.
