<div id="content">
 The historic reports and grant proposals are in /afs/cs.wisc.edu/p/condor/workspaces/adesmet/reports , one report or proposal per subdirectory.  The date is roughly when I started working on the given report. When the subdirectory is simply "report", it refers to whatever was paying for Flightworthy type work at the time. In many cases I only contributed some graphs or paragraphs to a report or grant proposal, so that is all that will be there.
