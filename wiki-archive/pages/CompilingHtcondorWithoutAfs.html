 <pre>    &gt; could you tell me how to build HTCondor on a machine w/o AFS
    &gt; under this new rule of build system?
</pre>
 <p>
  whoops!  i don't know if you ever got help with this, but i just found
your message burried in my inbox...
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <pre>    &gt; 1. copied files from /p/condor/workspaces/... to a private machine
    &gt; 2. changed 'Top' value of config/site.def accordingly
    &gt; 3. created build directory and symlinks under it appropriately (?):
    &gt;     + build/config -&gt; $(Top)/config
    &gt;     + build/imake -&gt; $(Top)/imake
</pre>
 <p>
  this is where you went wrong...
 </p>
 <p>
  you don't want build/imake itself to be a symlink to the top-level
$(Top)/imake.  you want the imake directory to be a local directory,
and all the files in $(Top)/imake to be symlinked into the imake
directory.  this is just like any directory of a given HTCondor daemon
inside src.  you need to locally compile your own copy of imake your
build workspace.
 </p>
 <p>
  the best thing to do if you're trying to not use AFS would probably be
to copy /p/condor/home/bin/new_workspace to your machine, too, and run
that.  it does everything for you, even editing your copy of
config/site.def to point to the right location.
 </p>
 <p>
  (can someone remind me of the magic perl incantation for the top of a
script so it works anywhere, instead of having a hard-coded path to
perl?)
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <pre>    &gt; 4. ran 'build/src/condor_imake'
</pre>
 <p>
  didn't this give you any error messages?
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <pre>    &gt; 5. ran 'make' under 'build/src' and got an error:
    &gt;     + Makefile:229: *** target file `submit.tar' has both : and :: entries.  Stop.
</pre>
 <p>
  this usually means you don't have a good version of imake...
 </p>
 <p>
  sorry for the delay in answering!
