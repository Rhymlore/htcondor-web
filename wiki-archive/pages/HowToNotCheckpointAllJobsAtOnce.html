title: How To Not Checkpoint All Jobs At Once
layout: wiki-page

<div id="content">
 If machines are configured to produce checkpoints at fixed intervals,
a large number of jobs are queued (submitted) at the same time,
and these jobs start on machines at about the same time,
then all these jobs will be trying to write out their checkpoints
at the same time.
It is likely to cause rather poor performance during this burst of
writing.
 <p>
  The RANDOM_INTEGER() macro can help in this instance.
Instead of defining PERIODIC_CHECKPOINT to be a fixed
interval, each machine is configured to randomly choose
one of a set of intervals.
For example, to set a machine's interval for producing checkpoints
to within the range of two to three hours, use the following
configuration:
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">PERIODIC_CHECKPOINT = $(LastCkpt) &gt; ( 2 * $(HOUR) + \
      $RANDOM_INTEGER(0,60,10) * $(MINUTE) )
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  The interval used is set at configuration time.
Each machine is randomly assigned a different interval
(2 hours, 2 hours and 10 minutes, 2 hours and 20 minutes, etc.)
at which to produce checkpoints.
Therefore, the various machines will not all attempt to
produce checkpoints at the same time.
