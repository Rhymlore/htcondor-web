<div id="content">
 The SHARED_PORT_ADDRESS_REWRITING feature was added as part of HTCondor 8.3.4 to provide dual-stack support for the HTCondor-CE.  See ticket

  <a class="resolved" href="tktview?tn=4849" title="Rewrite all ads leaving collector on single-node pool">
   #4849
  </a>
 </span>
 .
 <p>
  It allows the
  <code>
   condor_collector
  </code>
  process to rewrite all sinful strings that are on the same
  <code>
   condor_shared_port
  </code>
  server as the collector.  Thus, it allows for a completely functional dual-stack service if the entire pool is on the same host and behind a
  <code>
   condor_shared_port
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  This feature is purposely not documented within the manual as it is a special-purpose and experimental.  It is meant for a band-aid in the 8.3.x series before the "sinful string rewrite" is done in 8.5.x.
