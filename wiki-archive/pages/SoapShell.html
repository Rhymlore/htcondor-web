  If/when this makes it into the manual, this page can go away.  Until then, this page documents the condor_soapshell; development of this service is tracked in ticket

 <h3>
  Config file setup
 </h3>
 <p>
  Since it is a regular daemon core daemon, all the config options common to all HTCondor daemons are applicable.  In addition, the following parameters can be set:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <pre>   SOAPSHELL_AUTHORIZED_COMMANDS = cmdName,cmdPath,defaultArgs,defaultEnvironment,...
</pre>
 <p>
  So for each command you want users to be able to run, there will be four
comma seperated tuples in SOAPSHELL_AUTHROIZED_COMMANDS.  Note that spaces
are considered part of the values (so paths can have spaces) - only commas delimit
between tokens.  Here is an example:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <pre>   SOAPSHELL_AUTHORIZED_COMMANDS = date,/bin/date,,
</pre>
 <p>
  The above says the only authorized command is "date", and if a request arrives
asking for command "date", then the service will run /bin/date with no default
args and no default environment variables.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here is an example that shows configuring two commands:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <pre>   SOAPSHELL_AUTHORIZED_COMMANDS = date,/bin/date,,,ps,/bin/ps,-elf,
</pre>
 <p>
  The above says there are two authorized commands, "date" as before and "ps". If ps is requested, the service will run /bin/ps with -elf command-line args, and no default environment variables.
 </p>
 <p>
  The syntax for arguments and environment variables is just like it would appear
in a HTCondor submit file.
 </p>

 <h3>
  Using condor_soapshell
 </h3>
 <p>
  You can then run the service as yourself from the command line like:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <pre>   ./condor_soapshell -f -t -p 8080
</pre>
 <p>
  This will run it in the foreground, with the log going to the terminal, and
listening for incoming SOAP requests on port 8080.
 </p>
 <p>
  The methods in the WSDL allow you to send a request class ad either as a
  <span class="quote">
   ClassAdStruct
  </span>
  just like SOAP calls to the schedd or collector, or as a string of newline separated class ad attributes.  The request class ad looks like:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">Cmd = "cmdName"    (this must be a cmdName listed in SOAPSHELL_AUTHORIZED_COMMANDS)
Arguments = "--whatever"   (this is optional)
Environment = "foo=bar"    (this is optional)
In = "IUAOXIUS="   (base64 encoded data to be used as stdin; this is optional)
INPUT_FILE_NAME_1 = "file-name"
INPUT_FILE_DATA_1 = "ADJALSJJ="
INPUT_FILE_DATA_2 = ....
INPUT_FILE_DATA_2 = ....
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  You can specify as many input files as you want.
 </p>
 <p>
  The result class ad returned by the service will contain attributes for EXIT_STATUS, STDOUT and STDERR (base64 encoded), and a REQUEST_ID.
 </p>
 <p>
  All programs will be run in a temporary subdirectory that will be removed
when the program completes.
 </p>
</div>
