 have no concept of private or invisible attributes. This invisibility appears to only be used for dPrint() and some calls to put(). We could modify the put() in new

 </span>
 to take an optional second argument which indicates whether to include the statically-defined list of private attributes. We would also modify dPrint() and/or the unparser class to omit the private attributes.
 <p>
  There is also a static method called ClassAdAttributeIsPrivate(), which could become a free-standing function.
