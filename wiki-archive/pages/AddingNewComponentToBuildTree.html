 How to add a new component into the build system:
 <p>
  (By Carey. Loosely based on YIM dialogue with Peter Keller)
 </p>
 <p>
  Here we use terms "source" and "build" workspace. The "source" ws is what CVS makes when you do a check out. The "build" workspace is where you build, it has symmlinks to the source files in the "source" workspace, the Makefile, etc.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Add your source files to a subdirectory in the source workspace, entitled "condor_X", where
X is the name of your component (make sure it's prefixed with "condor_")
  </li>
  <li>
   Copy the Imakefile from ../condor_dcskel into your condor_X source directory
  </li>
  <li>
   Edit the Imakefile as necessary
	- you need to include $(DAEMONCORE_LIB) into LIB= section iff your component is a
   <span class="wiki">
    <a class="missing" href="wiki-archiveDaemonCore" title="Daemon Core">
     DaemonCore
    </a>
   </span>
   process (e.g. condor_startd , as opposed to a standalone tool like condor_submit)
  </li>
  <li>
   In the ../Imakefile (the main Imakefile), make the following changes:
   <ol>
    <li>
     Add your entry to the #define Programs... section (before dcskel in that section)
    </li>
    <li>
     !!!add just the name "X", NOT "condor_X"!!!
    </li>
    <li>
     Add  object_target(X) right before object_target(dcskel)
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Go to your build workspace and do
   <ol>
    <li>
     make reallyclean
    </li>
    <li>
     condor_imake			// This should create a dir and a Makefile for your new component in the build space
    </li>
    <li>
     make
    </li>
    <li>
     make release
    </li>
   </ol>
  </li>
 </ol>
