 <p>
  Known to work with HTCondor version: 7.0
 </p>
 <p>
  By default, HTCondor adjusts user priorities over time based on how many slots the user claims.  A user who has recently used a lot of the pool will therefore tend to have a worse priority than one who has used it less.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you wish to disable HTCondor's automatic adjustment of user priorities, you can effectively do so with the following configuration setting:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">PRIORITY_HALFLIFE = 1.0e100
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  Then a user's priority will be effectively constant.  Note this means that if all your users have the same priority factor, machines will essentially be assigned in a round-robin manner across all users without regard to how much usage a user received in the past.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, you could still adjust the relative priority of users, as usual:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">condor_userprio -setfactor &lt;user1&gt; 10
condor_userprio -setfactor &lt;user2&gt; 20
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  In the example above, user1 should be able to claim twice as many machines as user2 (because user priorities are inversely proportional to share of the pool).
 </p>
