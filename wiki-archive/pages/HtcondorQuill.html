 <p>
  <em>
   Note that Quill is no longer tested or supported starting with HTCondor v8.4.0!!

  Quill consists of two daemons,
  <code>
   condor_quill
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   condor_dbmsd
  </code>
  . It manages a database that represents a copy of the HTCondor job queue.
  <code>
   condor_q
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   condor_history
  </code>
  tools can then query the database.
