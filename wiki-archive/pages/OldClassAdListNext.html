<div id="content">
 <span class="quote">
  ClassadIterator
 </span>
 in the new classads is deprecated.
 <p>
  There's no direct mapping from
  <span class="wiki">
   <a class="missing" href="wiki-archiveClassadList" title="Classad List">
    ClassadList
   </a>
  </span>
  in the old classads. But
  <span class="wiki">
   <a class="missing" href="wiki-archiveExprList" title="Expr List">
    ExprList
   </a>
  </span>
  can be used. It uses STL iterators, and hence may need some small bit of work.

 <p>
  Developer time: 57 calls need to be fixed. couple of hours.
