 A good commit message makes reviewing your changes later easier, and is especially helpful when the release wrangler is ensuring that the version history is complete.
 <p>
  A commit message should have:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The
   <span class="wiki">
    <a class="missing" href="wiki-archiveGitTrac" title="Git Trac">
     GitTrac
    </a>
   </span>
   ticket number, in the form
   <span class="ticket">
    <a class="new" href="tktview?tn=123" title="Grand unified param() system: Phase 1">
     #123
    </a>
   </span>
   .  Note that you cannot have a "#" at the start of a line; Git will think it's a comment.  Common techniques include putting the comment at the end of the line, or enclosing it in parenthesis like (
   <span class="ticket">
    <a class="new" href="tktview?tn=123" title="Grand unified param() system: Phase 1">
     #123
    </a>
   </span>
   ), or putting it in a gliss.  If multiple tickets are involved, feel free to list them all.  If zero tickets are involved, consider creating a ticket so people have a place to discuss the change and a convenient place to point to for all relevant information.
   <ul>
    <li>
     Why? This number makes correlating the version history easier (assuming you include the ticket number in a comment in the version history like you should).  It also means that the ticket can include links to the relevant commits.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   A brief description of what you changed.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Optionally, some extended discussion on what you changed, if you think it useful.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Remember to update the
   <span class="wiki">
    <a href="wiki-archiveVersionHistoryHowTo" title="Version History How To">
     Version History!
    </a>
   </span>
   . If you are confident that this change should not be mentioned in the version history, include a brief note explaining why - for instance, is it entirely invisible to the user (internal cleanup) or does it fix a bug that was never released?
