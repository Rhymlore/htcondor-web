 <h2>
  Phases
 </h2>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   use newer socket API without supporting IPv6 at all
  </li>
  <li>
   introduce ipaddr structure, which is capable of storing IPv6 address. (but no IPv6 support)
  </li>
  <li>
   Support IPv6
  </li>
  <li>
   (maybe) support dual stack (IPv4 and IPv6 on single daemon, single socket)
  </li>
 </ol>

 <h3>
  Phase 1
 </h3>
 <p>
  step 0:  thursday, april 29
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   list all functions that need to be ipv6 aware.  gethostbyname, gethostbyaddr, etc.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   create wrappers for each of the above functions if they do not exist.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   find all call sites for above functions and use wrapper instead
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  step 1:  friday, april 30
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   reimplement gethostbyname (and others) to invoke getaddrinfo() instead, and copy resulting ipv4 address into hostent structure, and return.  this does not change the signature of condor_gethostbyname().
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  step 2:  monday, may 3
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   deal with inet_ntoa and family?
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>

 <h3>
  Phase 2
 </h3>
 <p>
  step 3:  monday, may 10
(should be step 1 of Phase 2)
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   introduce ipaddr class (which encapsulates both v4 and v6 addresses) and
 change function signatures where needed.  update call sites.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  step 4:  wednesday, may 12
(step 2 of Phase 2)
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   introduce condor_hostent (might actually be equivalent to addrinfo), change function signatures, update call sites.  hostent was static, so also add calls to free() for the new condor_hostent structure.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  everything to here done by may 14th.
 </p>
 <p>
  step 5: (next semester)
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   actually populate the condor_hostent and ipaddr classes with ipv6 data.  watch what breaks, come up with a plan.  ipverify() and many other places in HTCondor which assume 4-byte ip address or 21-byte address strings will need to be updated.
  </li>
 </ol>

 <h4>
  Complications
 </h4>
 <p>
  There's tricky thing on Phase 1. We decided not to remove struct hostent which is also obsolete. FYI,
struct hostent is returned by gethostbyname() and is used for DNS lookup.
 </p>
 <p>
  The newer API for gethostbyname() is getnameinfo(). Indeed, getnameinfo() does not return struct
hostent. Thus, I wrote a wrapper function that returns struct hostent using getnameinfo().
 </p>
 <p>
  The problem is that getnameinfo() does not return exact same information as gethostbyname() returns.
Although getnameinfo() is replacement for gethostbyname(), they behave differently! Alternate
hostname (hostname alias) could be different. I will send you the code that shows different behavior
of gehostbyname() and getnameinfo().
 </p>
 <p>
  I am not sure if it would break the compatibility. We may need to discuss how we can treat semantic
difference of gethostbyname() and getnameinfo().
