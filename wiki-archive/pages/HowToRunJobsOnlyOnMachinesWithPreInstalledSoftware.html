title: How To Run Jobs Only On Machines With Pre Installed Software
layout: wiki-page

<div id="content">
 The naive way to do this is to know ahead of time exactly which machines have the software, and then constrain the
 <code>
  Requirements
 </code>
 expression of the job so that it only matches those machines.  Knowing ahead of time is problematic and difficult to maintain as the pool changes.  A better solution uses this two-step process.
 <p>
  First, each machine that has the special software installed needs to advertise its availability in its machine
  <span class="wiki">
   <a class="missing" href="wiki-archiveClassAd" title="Class Ad">
    ClassAd
   </a>
  </span>
  . Second, the job identifies in its submit description file that it requires a machine that has the special software.
 </p>
 <p>
  A machine advertises the presence of special software in its local configuration file, as in this example:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">HAS_MY_SOFTWARE = True
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  Also, if
  <code>
   STARTD_ATTRS
  </code>
  is already defined in that file, add
  <code>
   HAS_MY_SOFTWARE
  </code>
  to the list. If
  <code>
   STARTD_ATTRS
  </code>
  is not already in
that local configuration file, add the line:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">STARTD_ATTRS = HAS_MY_SOFTWARE, $(STARTD_ATTRS)
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  For this configuration change to take effect, the condor_startd on that machine
needs to be reconfigured. Use
  <code>
   condor_reconfig -startd
  </code>
  .  Each machine with
the configuration change must be reconfigured.
 </p>
 <p>
  Double check that this has been correctly implemented by running the condor_status command:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">condor_status -constraint HAS_MY_SOFTWARE
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  Jobs that need to run on the machines with the special software installedadd a
  <code>
   Requirements
  </code>
  command to their submit description file:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">Requirements = (HAS_MY_SOFTWARE =?= True)
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  Be sure to use
  <strong>
   =?=
  </strong>
  instead of
  <strong>
   ==
  </strong>
  , so that if a machine does not have
the
  <code>
   HAS_MY_SOFTWARE
  </code>
  configuration variable defined, the job's
  <code>
   Requirements
  </code>
  expression will not evaluate to
  <code>
   Undefined
  </code>
  , preventing the job from
running anywhere.
