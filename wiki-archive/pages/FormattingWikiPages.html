title: Formatting Wiki Pages
layout: wiki-page
---
<div id="content">
 <strong class="two">
  Paragraphs
 </strong>
 <p>
  Use one or more blank lines to separate paragraphs.  If the
first line of a paragraph begins with a tab or with two or
more spaces, then that whole paragraph is shown verbatim
(that is, within &lt;pre&gt;...&lt;/pre&gt; markup in HTML.)  The
formatting rules below do not apply to verbatim paragraphs.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong class="two">
   Fonts
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Text contained between asterisks is rendered in a
  <strong>
   bold font.
  </strong>
  If you use two or three asterisks in a row, instead of just
one, the bold text is also shown in a larger font.
Text between underscores is rendered in an
  <em>
   italic font.
  </em>
  Text between equals is rendered in a
  <code>
   fixed font.
  </code>
  All font markers must start at the beginning of a word and must
finish at the end of a word within the same paragraph.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong class="two">
   Lists
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  If a line begins with the characters "*:" followed by a space or
tab, then that line becomes an item in a bullet list.  Similarly,
if the line begins with "N:" (where N is any number including a
multi-digit number) then the line becomes an item in an
enumeration list. Enumeration items are automatically renumbered
so the values of N do not need to be in accending order.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lines that begin with "_:" are indented like a
bullet list but do not display the bullet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Make nested lists by adding colons.  For example, to make a
second level bullet, begin the line with "*::".
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong class="two">
   Hyperlinks
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Links to other pages are created automatically whenever the name
of another wiki page is mentioned in the text.  (See
  <span class="wiki">
   <a href="{{ '/wiki-archive/pages/WikiPageNames' | relative_url }}" title="Wiki Page Names">
    WikiPageNames
   </a>
  </span>
  .)
If you want to use alternative text, use the form
"
  <span class="quote">
   {wiki: TITLE TEXT}
  </span>
  ".
If you want to put a
  <span class="wiki">
   <a href="{{ '/wiki-archive/pages/CamelCase' | relative_url }}" title="Camel Case">
    CamelCase
   </a>
  </span>
  word in your text but you do not
want it to become a hyperlink, enclose the name in
"
  <span class="quote">
   {quote: ...}
  </span>
  ".
 </p>
 <p>
  A link to an external website is created for every URL beginning
with "http:", "https:", "ftp:", or "mailto:".  If the URL ends with
".jpg", ".jpeg", ".gif", or ".png" then the image that the URL points
to is displayed inline on the wiki page.  You can also create an
inline image using markup like this: "
  <span class="quote">
   {image: URL}
  </span>
  ".
Using the
  <span class="quote">
   {image:...}
  </span>
  markup allows the image URL to be
relative.  This allows an image stored in an
attachment to be displayed inline.
 </p>
 <p>
  Text of the form
  <strong>
   #NNN
  </strong>
  where the
  <strong>
   NNN
  </strong>
  is a valid ticket number
becomes a hyperlink to the ticket.  Text of the form
  <strong>
   [NNN]
  </strong>
  where
  <strong>
   NNN
  </strong>
  is a valid check-in or milestone number becomes a hyperlink
to that check-in or milestone.  This hyperlinks only work if the
user has permission to read tickets, check-ins, and/or milestones.
 </p>
 <p>
  A pathname for any file in the repository becomes a hyperlink to its
"rlog" page. This only works if the user has check-out permissions.
 </p>
 <p>
  To create a hyperlink on arbitrary text, use "
  <span class="quote">
   {link: ...}
  </span>
  "
markup.  Any text of the form:  "
  <span class="quote">
   {link: URL PHRASE}
  </span>
  "
displays PHRASE as hyperlink to URL.  URL can be an absolute
URL beginning with a prefix like "http:", or it can be a
relative URL referring to another page within the same CVSTrac
server.  For example, to create a link to a report, one might
write: "
  <span class="quote">
   {link: rptview?rn=1 Active Tickets}
  </span>
  ".
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong class="two">
   Horizontal Lines
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  A horizontal line (the &lt;hr&gt; markup of HTML) is generated
whenever four or more "-" characters appear on a line by
themselves.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong class="two">
   Tables
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  A table is created by starting a line with a "|" character, separating each
cell with a "|", and ending each row with a "|". For example, a 3x3 table is
created with:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <pre>  |cell 1|cell 2|cell 3|
  |cell 4|cell 5|cell 6|
  |cell 7|cell 8|cell 9|
</pre>
 <p>
  <strong class="two">
   Reports
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  A
  <a href="reportlist">
   report
  </a>
  can be embedded on any page using the
"
  <span class="quote">
   {report: rn}
  </span>
  " markup. A report can have text flow around
it using the "
  <span class="quote">
   {leftreport: rn}
  </span>
  " or "
  <span class="quote">
   {rightreport: rn}
  </span>
  "
markups. Note that the report number
  <em>
   rn
  </em>
  is not the same as the order
in the
  <a href="reportlist">
   report listing
  </a>
  ; follow the link for the report
in order to get that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong class="two">
   Other Markup Rules
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The special markup "
  <span class="quote">
   {linebreak}
  </span>
  " will be rendered
as a line break or hard return.  The content of
"
  <span class="quote">
   {quote: ...}
  </span>
  " markup is shown verbatim.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
