   Open a ticket for discussing your contribution (either enhancement or bug fix); you can read about our ticket process
   <span class="wiki">
    <a "CvstracTicket" title="Cvstrac Ticket">
     here
    </a>
   </span>
   or by clicking [Help] at the top of the
   <a href="tktnew">
    new ticket page
   </a>
   .  If your contribution is a small/trivial patch or bugfix, you could simply attach a patch file directly to the ticket page (at the top of the ticket page, select
   <code>
    Attach
   </code>
   ). If your change is an enhancement (new feature) or large bug fix, you will need to author and attach a
   <span class="wiki">
    <a "DesignDoc" title="Design Doc">
     design document
    </a>
   </span>
   to the ticket page for architecture review and get it approved before code contributions will be accepted. It is appreciated if you openly discuss design with committers via the htcondor-devel mailing list.

   announcing your ticket to find a committer to help you
  </li>
  <li>
   Make sure: you work with a committer, your code compiles on all platforms, your code meets guidelines, you include test a procedure
  </li>
  <li>
   Assign your ticket to the committer and change its status to review
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  Your code contributions will be much more happily received if you observe the following guidelines:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Submit your contribution as a patch to most recent version of the HTCondor source code.
  </li>
  <li>
   State which version of the HTCondor source your patch is relative to.
  </li>
  <li>
   When generating your patch, use one of the diff formats that provides context (i.e.
   <code>
    diff -c
   </code>
   or
   <code>
    diff -u
   </code>
   ).
  </li>
  <li>
   When modifying existing source files, try to match the formatting style of the surrounding code.
  </li>
 </ul>
