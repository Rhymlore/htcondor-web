 <p>
  This page denotes a HTCondor feature which allows HTCondor to change various
aspects about itself away from the "condor" name. This was primarily created
as a helper for the "Hawkeye" feature of HTCondor since it used its own config
files that sat next to a HTCondor installation.

  Effect of the codebase
 </h2>

 <ul>
  <li>
   Environment Variables
   <ul>
    <li>
     EnvGetName() is a critical location to understand.
    </li>
    <li>
     condor_environ.cpp
    </li>
    <li>
     condor_environ.h
    </li>
    <li>
     Things like _CONDOR_mumble are branded in that CONDOR can be changed to HAWKEYE or anything else. Any environment variables the code speciifically looks for in this manner can be changed. This mechanism is also what the param() system uses when you specify _CONDOR_mumble to set config file variables.
    </li>
    <li>
     There is a hard coded list of special environment variables whose names are affected by the distribution name.
    </li>

     ~condor is an example, could be ~hawkeye if desired.
    </li>
    <li>
     init_tilde() is an example in our code
    </li>
