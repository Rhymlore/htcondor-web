   <ol>
    <li>
     Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include install/lib.

    <li>
     Copied libvomsapi.so* to install/lib.

    <li>
     Removed a directory created by lib_eventlog_base but not removed when it failed; re-running a third time permitted its success.

    <li>
     Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the environment of the submitted job (via the submit file command) for lib_userlog.

     Discovered that the test job_file_xfer_md5-remote_van was hanging (and failing after a time-out) because the VM didn't have enough disk space.

 <h2>
  Build the Full Port
 </h2>
 <p>
  I rebuilt in the clipped port tree, and was gratified to see that implementing the glibc external enabled building standard universe.
 </p>
 <p>
  Build problems were generally resolved by adding GLIBC213 to all the conditions that had GLIBC212.
 </p>
 <p>
  I reran the test suite, and it had a lot of problems.  Don't forget to LD_LIBRARY_PATH as well as CONDOR_CONFIG and your PATH.  Testing with stand-alone checkpointing revealed that I'd missed a few GLIBC212 -&gt; GLIBC213 additions, particularly including in the code that determines the location of the stack; this caused checkpointing to fail.  I went back and added GLIBC213 everywhere there was GLIBC212 (only two other places) and retested, which went a lot better.  (Note that you have to remove the test binaries; CMake won't rebuild them after this change.)
 </p>
 <p>
  At least one of the standard universe tests chews a truly excessive amount of RAM (7.5 GB), so I had to adjust the configuration of the default personal HTCondor (the test glue created it with 15 slots) to allow it to actually run after it checkpointed.
 </p>
 <p>
  After sufficient bullying, all but three non standard-universe tests passed locally, so it was on to checking the build in BaTLab.  In order to do so, I cloned the x86_64_Debian6 entry in SubmitInfo.pm.  Additionally, because the test machine kept its HTCondor installation in a nonstandard location, I had to adjust condor_compile (so it would work if given enough information on the command-line, as opposed to suicide when condor_config_val failed to return information that would be later ignored) and condor_arch_link (which also used condor_config_val in a way that unncessarily assumed the existence of an HTCondor config file).
 </p>
 <p>
  Adding the LIGO test was pretty straightforward.
