 </p>
 <p>
  A timeline is basically a table of CVSTrac objects. Normally, these objects are
broken up by day or by milestone. Each object is dated, has some kind of
identifying icon, a description of the object,
  <em>
   some
  </em>
  detail about the change,
the name of the user responsible, and, if you have sufficient permissions, a
link to a more detailed view of the object.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the bottom of the page is a grouping of controls to change various timeline
settings.

   Filtering
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Most of the timeline toggles are about filtering what objects are seen. It's
also possible to control the time window shown in the timeline by adjusting the
number of days and the end date/time.

   Preferences
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  If you change any timeline settings, the new settings are stored in a browser
cookie. Additionally, a user with
  <strong>
   admin
  </strong>
  settings can force his/her current
timeline settings to be the default for all other users.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong class="two">
   Activity Feeds
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The timeline is available as an RSS feed. Just follow the "RSS" link if the
site admin doesn't have feed auto-discovery enabled.
