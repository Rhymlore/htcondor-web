title: Migrating Cvs Workspace To Git

<div id="content">
 During the transition period between CVS and GIT, developers will have CVS workspaces which contain changes that have to be moved over to a git workspace. Currently, the HTCondor source code CVS repository is frozen and in read only mode. So what you do is this:
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code"># Prepare the our code in the CVS workspace we have
$ cd /old/cvs/workspace

# If your workspace was behind the times, then this will update it to where
# the CVS repository was frozen.
$ cvs update

# resolve any conflicts

# cd to the toplevel (containing config/ src/ imake/ etc.) directory and
# produce a patch file
$ cvs -q diff -u &gt;&amp; cdiff

# edit the top of the patch file to remove any lines denoted with ?
$ vim ....

# prepare a git repository (as in previous stages in this tutorial) and
# ensure that you've checked out the corresponding branch as from the workspace
# you are getting your changes.
$ git clone /p/condor/repository/CONDOR_SRC.git
$ git branch &lt;your_branch&gt; origin/&lt;your_branch&gt;
$ git checkout &lt;your_branch&gt;

# then copy the cdiff file to the toplevel of the git workspace
$ cp /old/cvs/workspace/cdiff ./CONDOR_SRC

# Then patch the workspace using GNU patch
$ cd ./CONDOR_SRC
$ patch -p0 &lt; cdiff

# If any of the patches do not apply cleanly, resolve conflicts.

# At this point check the diffs to ensure you changed what you thought you
# changed. Do be careful to get this correct.
$ git diff

# Then commit your changes
$ git commit -a

# and push
$ git push
</pre>
 </div>
