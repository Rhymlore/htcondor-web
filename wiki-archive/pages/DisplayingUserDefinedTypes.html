   Customized Type Display

 </span>
 <p>
  You can customize how Visual C++ displays classes in the variable view. By default VC++ displays "{...}" and you need to click the small '+' icon to expand the members. You can change this behaviour, and make Visual C++ display whatever data member you want, in whatever order and in whatever format you like.
 </p>
 <p>
  You need to locate a file called
  <code>
   AUTOEXP.DAT
  </code>
  in your Visual C++ installation. By default it will be:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   VC++ 6.0:
   <ul>
    <li>
     <code>
      C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Common\MSDev98\Bin\AUTOEXP.DAT
     </code>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   VC++ 9.0:
   <ul>
    <li>
     <code>
      C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\Packages\Debugger\autoexp.dat
     </code>
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  After you have made the changes and saved the file, you will need to restart Visual C++ for the changes to take effect.

  For a more in depth look at this option, and it's extensive range of uses, please refere to the folowing document:

   Customize autoexp.dat for own types in VS2005
  </a>
  .  The page mentions the contents is aimed at Visual Studio 2005, but, having tested it, I've found that it works in both Visual Studio 2008 and 2010 Beta.
