title: How To Configure Folding At Home
layout: wiki-page

<div id="content">
 Here's how to contribute your HTCondor pool's spare cycles to Folding@Home.
 <p>
  The basic idea is to use HTCondor's "work fetch" mechanism to start the Folding@Home client when you have idle resources.  This means you don't have Folding@Home jobs cluttering up your schedulers or in your the accountant, and you don't have to do anything special to preserve your Folding@Home progress.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you wish to run Folding@Home jobs as work submitted to a HTCondor Schedd and tracked by HTCondor's accounting mechanism
  <em>
   this is not the recipe for you

 <h4>
  Assumptions
 </h4>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   We assume that you're configuring a Linux execute machine.
  </li>
  <li>
   We assume that execute machine already has Folding@Home installed.  Many of the ways to install the Folding@Home client on a machine try to configure it to run in the background; you'll want to disable that.
  </li>
  <li>
   We assume that
   <code>
    /opt/fah
   </code>
   is a great place to put our Folding@Home bits.
  </li>
 </ul>

 <h4>
  Instructions
 </h4>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Create user named 'backfill' for Folding@Home to run as.
  </li>
  <li>
   Make directories so that Folding@Home can preserve its progress when preempted: create
   <code>
    /opt/fah/slots/slot1
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    /opt/fah/slots/slot2/
   </code>
   , and the like (up to the number of cores on your machine).  Make sure that the 'backfill' user can read and write to them (
   <code>
    chown
   </code>
   them appropriately).
  </li>
  <li>
   Create the following files:
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="file">
  <pre class="filelabel">/opt/fah/fetch_work</pre>
  <pre class="file">#!/bin/bash
# extract SlotId from the Machine classad passed on stdin
eval `awk '/^SlotID/ {print "export _CONDOR_BACKFILL_SLOTID="$3}'`
# build a job classad from a template in the HTcondor config called FAH_JOB
condor_config_val -macro '$(FAH_JOB)'
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  The following configuration can be changed if you want credit for your contribution.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="file">
  <pre class="filelabel">/opt/fah/config.xml</pre>
  <pre class="file">&lt;config&gt;
  &lt;!-- Client Control --&gt;
  &lt;fold-anon v='true'/&gt;

  &lt;!-- Folding Slot Configuration --&gt;
  &lt;gpu v='false'/&gt;

  &lt;!-- Folding Slots --&gt;
  &lt;slot id='0' type='CPU'/&gt;
&lt;/config&gt;
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   If you're using static slots, use
   <span class="wiki">
    <a "FoldingAtHomeStaticSlots" title="Folding At Home Static Slots">
     this recipe
    </a>
   </span>
   for your configuration.
  </li>
  <li>
   If you're using partitionable slots, use
   <span class="wiki">
    <a "FoldingAtHomeDynamicSlots" title="Folding At Home Dynamic Slots">
     this recipe
    </a>
   </span>
   for your configuration.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  Example output showing one idle partitionable slot and 4 slots that will only run backfill jobs.
