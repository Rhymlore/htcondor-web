  How to make VMware jobs run
 </strong>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Have a script in the correct run level linked to one in /etc/init.d
   which will do your job if it is present but allow the machine to come up
   for adjustments if not. (sample scripts below)
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Have a second disk configured in your VM which is used to place input data
   and extract output data
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Have patience as the job happens in a black box.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  In order for this all to work you must have a VM which is rich enough
to have "mkfs" which has the "-t vfat" option to make a windows vat32 partition.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given that you have such a second disk created. The trick now is to use
a combination of gemu-img and mtools to build a disk you can mount from
within the VM and based on it's contents, run the job or simply bring up
the VM for inspection.
 </p>
 <p>
  Qemu-img can be downloaded from "
  <a class="external" href="http://www.qemu.org/download.html">
   http://www.qemu.org/download.html
  </a>
  ".
 </p>
 <p>
  Mtools can be downloaded from "
  <a class="external" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/download.html">
   http://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/download.html
  </a>
  ".
 </p>
 <p>
  Once you have a
  <span class="wiki">
   <a class="missing" href="wiki-archiveVmWare" title="Vm Ware">
    VmWare
   </a>
  </span>
  raw disk you can use mtools on it to add things to the disk or pull things from it. However note that every use of the disk makes it larger so you should retain a pristine copy of the original empty disk.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mtools requires an rc file to define drives. A sample is here:
 </p>
 <p>
  drive n: file="/home/bt/SOAR/sources/sscc_cbf/v1/code/DSLstata-0.raw" offset=32256 mtools_skip_check=1
 </p>
 <p>
  One places such information into a file which you point to
with the environment variable "MTOOLSRC".
 </p>
 <p>
  When HTCondor completes a
  <span class="wiki">
   <a class="missing" href="wiki-archiveVmWare" title="Vm Ware">
    VmWare
   </a>
  </span>
  job its returns all the files
of the VM to the run directory allowing one to restart the VM and
look inside.
  <strong>
   However if you use the procedures here, you will want to copy in an
empty second disk or it will startup and run the job again
or error as it did the last time depending where you
are in creating your job within the VM.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  A simple submit file for HTCondor which has the
  <span class="wiki">
   <a class="missing" href="wiki-archiveVmWare" title="Vm Ware">
    VmWare
   </a>
  </span>
  files
in a directory called vmware_dir looks like this and note that the
executable is simply the name of the job that condor_q uses to
display it in the queue:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <pre>  universe = vm
  vm_type = vmware
  vmware_dir = vmware_dir
  executable = sscc_cbf_vm
  log = sscc_cbf_vm.log
  vmware_should_transfer_files = YES
  vmware_snapshot_disk = false
  vm_memory = 1000
  notification = never
  queue
</pre>
 <p>
  Below are some Perl functions to use the above tools:

  #
  #   VM Universe code for VmWare
  #
  #   Initializing the VM for a job and accessing the
  #   results are done by including a suitable second
  #   VmWare disk. This disk is created for dynamic
  #   allocation and created in a VM which can use fdisk
  #   to create a fat32 partition and must have an
  #   mkfs which allows a "-t vfat" to complete creation
  #   of the disk.
  #
  #   Once one has this disk it can be used as a template
  #   second drive for any VmWare VM. Note keep the core
  #   empty disk and copy it when needed as it gets
  #   larger with every use.
  #
  #   We rely on "mtools" and "qemu" for the rest.
  #   "qemu-img" is used to convert the disk back and forth
  #   between vmdk and raw formats. "mcopy, mdir etc"
  #   are used to place and fetch files off the raw
  #   disk.

run level and deciding if a job should be run or the VM simply brought up for
changes or inspection.
