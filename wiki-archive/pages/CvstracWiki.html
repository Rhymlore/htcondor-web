   Revisions
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Each version of a CVSTrac wiki page is kept in the database. This means that
the entire history of a page can be examined, differences identified, old
changes resurrected, etc.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   History
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Clicking the
  <strong>
   History
  </strong>
  link on any wiki page will toggle on a list of all
revisions of the page, including the datestamp and user who made the change.
It's then possible to quickly view each version of the page. It's also possible
to
  <a "DeleteWiki">
   delete
  </a>
  specific revisions of a page.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wiki page revisions which have been deleted will, obviously, not be available
in this list.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Diff
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Clicking on the
  <strong>
   Diff
  </strong>
  link for any revision of a wiki page will show the
changes between that revision and the previous revision.
 </p>

   Attachments

 </p>
 <p>
  Arbitrary files can be
  <span class="wiki">
   <a "CvstracAttachment" title="Cvstrac Attachment">
    attached
   </a>
  </span>
  to wiki pages
by clicking on the
  <strong>
   Attach
  </strong>
  link and uploading files.
 </p>
 <p>
  Attachments to a page can be reference by filename in
  <span class="quote">
   {image:}
  </span>
  markup
sections, allowing images to be attached to pages and directly embedded in the
page content.
