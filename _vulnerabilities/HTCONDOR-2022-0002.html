title: HTCONDOR-2022-0002
summary: |
    A piece of secret information is sent over the network in the clear if
    the administrator has configured weaker encryption protocols or if
    some of the HTCondor daemons are version 8.8 or earlier.
    An attacker could use this secret information to control the slot of
    another user, including running their own code as that user.
    An attacker could also impersonate a condor_negotiator and
    condor_startd, tricking the condor_schedd into sending them the jobs
    of any user.

    title: CVE-2021-45104
component: Schedd daemon
vulnerable_versions: 8.9.3 and above
platform: All platforms
availability: Not known to be publicly exploited
fix_available: 9.0.10, 9.6.0
status: Verified
access_required:
    summary: Ability to capture network traffic between Schedd and Startd or Collector
    content: |
        An attacker must be able to capture network traffic between a
        condor_schedd and a condor_startd or condor_collector.
        The HTCondor daemons must be configured to use BLOWFISH or 3DES
        encryption (the default is AES in 9.0 and above) and match password
        authentication enabled (the default) to be vulnerable.
        A condor_schedd communicating to a version 8.8 peer is most likely to
        be vulnerable.
host_type_required: N/A
effort_required:
    summary: High
    content: |
        A good understanding of the HTCondor network protocol and access to
        network traffic.
impact_consequences:
    summary: High
    content: |
        Using the secret information, an attacker could manipulate a user's
        running job, including evicting that job or replacing that job with
        one that executes the attacker's own code.
        The attacker could impersonate a condor_startd and cause the
        condor_schedd to send them a user's jobs for execution, allowing the
        attacker to read private data and return bogus results.

workaround: |
    Upgrading all HTCondor daemons to version 9.0.10 or 9.6.0 fully
    addresses this vulnerability.
    <p>
    If upgrading isn't possible, the easiest workaround is to ensure all machines are running HTCondor
    9.0.0 or above, and that the <code>SEC_XXX_ENCRYPTION_METHODS</code>
    configuration parameters are either unset or list "AES" as the first
    entry.
    <p>
    If some machines cannot be upgraded to 9.0.0 or above, then you can
    configure all machines to use encryption for all communications.
    To do this, set <code>SEC_DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION=REQUIRED</code> and ensure no other
    <code>SEC_XXX_ENCRYPTION</code> parameters set a different value.
    In 9.0 and above, the configuration templates <code>use SECURITY: strong</code>
    and <code>use SECURITY: recommended_v9_0</code> also enable encryption.
    <p>
    If some of your execute or central manager machines cannot be upgraded
    to 9.0.0 or above and their configuration cannot be altered to require
    encryption, you can disable match password authentication on your
    submit machines.
    To do this, set <code>SEC_ENABLE_MATCH_PASSWORD_AUTHENTICATION=False</code> in
    the configuration files.
    Be advised that this may require additional configuration for
    authentication and authorization between your submit and execute
    machines.
    It can also put significant extra load on your submit machines in a
    large pool (thousands of nodes).
full_details: Embargoed until future notice.
