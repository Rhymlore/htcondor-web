    For jobs that request HTCondor to transfer files to or from S3 cloud
    storage, pre-signed URLs that can be used to access private files are
    written to daemon logs and the job ad.

    title: CVE-2021-45103
component: Schedd, Shadow, Starter daemons
vulnerable_versions: 8.9.4 and above
platform: All platforms
availability: Not known to be publicly exploited
fix_available: 9.0.10, 9.6.0
status: Verified
access_required:
    summary: Login or READ access to Schedd
    content: |
        An attacker able to login to a Schedd or Startd machine can obtain
        pre-signed URLs for all jobs that passed through that machine.
        An attacker with READ access to the SchedD can obtain pre-signed URLs
        for any jobs for which S3 transfers failed.
host_type_required: Submit or Execute host
effort_required:
    summary: Low
    content: |
        An attacker can obtain pre-signed URLs for all jobs by searching the
        daemon logs of the condor_shadow or condor_starter.
        They can obtain pre-signed URLs for jobs with an S3 transfer error
        using the command line tools.
        These URLs can be trivially used to access the associated files in S3.
impact_consequences:
    summary: Medium
    content: |
        The attacker can access the S3 file associated with each pre-signed
        URL. This can include both reading and writing of the data.

workaround: |
    Upgrading all HTCondor daemons to version 9.0.10 or 9.6.0 fully
    addresses this vulnerability.
    <p>
    If upgrading is not possible, you can work around this issue by disabling the generation of
    pre-signed URLs by HTCondor. To do so, set the following in your
    configuration files:
    <div style="text-indent: 3em;">
    <pre>SIGN_S3_URLS = False</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
    For jobs that use file transfer to/from S3 for private data, you must
    then devise another access path. This can include providing a file transfer
    plugin that supports the 's3' or 'gs' scheme.
full_details: Embargoed until future notice.
