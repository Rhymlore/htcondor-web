workaround: |
    You can work around this issue by not allowing SciTokens as an
    authentication method.  This means overriding the list of
    authentication methods (which includes SciTokens by default) by
    setting SEC_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS to all the methods you
    would actually like to use.  To simply remove SciTokens, set it to
    "FS,TOKEN,KERBEROS,GSI,SSL".
