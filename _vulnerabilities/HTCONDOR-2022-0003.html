title: HTCONDOR-2022-0003
summary: |
    When a user authenticates to an HTCondor daemon using the CLAIMTOBE
    method, the user can then impersonate any entity when issuing additional
    commands to that daemon.

    title: CVE-2022-26110
component: All daemons
vulnerable_versions: All versions
platform: All platforms
availability: Not known to be publicly exploited
fix_available: 8.8.16, 9.0.10, 9.6.0
status: Verified
access_required:
    summary: READ access to any daemon
    content: |
        An attacker need only have READ-level authorization to a vulnerable
        daemon using the CLAIMTOBE authentication method.
        This means they are able to run tools like condor_q or condor_status.
        Many pools do not restrict who can issue READ-level commands, and
        CLAIMTOBE is allowed for READ-level commands in the default
        configuration.
        Thus, it is likely that an attacker could execute this command remotely
        from an untrusted network, unless prevented by a firewall or other
        network-level access controls.
host_type_required: Submit or Execute host
effort_required:
    summary: Medium
    content: |
        An attacker would need to write custom tools and be familiar with
        HTCondor's internal communication APIs to carry out a successful
        attack.
impact_consequences:
    summary: High
    content: |
        This attack allows a user to impersonate any user, administrator, or
        daemon, and issue any command they are authorized for to the vulnerable
        daemon.

workaround: |
    Upgrading all HTCondor daemons to version 8.8.16, 9.0.10, or 9.6.0 fully
    addresses this vulnerability.
    <p>
    If upgrading isn't possible, you can work around this issue by not allowing the CLAIMTOBE
    authentication method. This means overriding the default list of
    authentication methods for READ authorization  (which includes
    CLAIMTOBE by default).
    On linux and macOS, add this to your configuration files:
    <div style="text-indent: 3em;">
        <pre>SEC_READ_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS = FS,IDTOKENS,KERBEROS,SCITOKENS,SSL</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
    On Windows, add this to your configuration files:
    <div style="text-indent: 3em;">
        <pre>SEC_READ_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS = NTSSPI,IDTOKENS,KERBEROS,SCITOKENS,SSL
    </div>

    <p>
    If you installed HTCondor with the <code>get_htcondor</code> tool,
    then <code>SEC_READ_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS</code> has already been
    set to exclude CLAIMTOBE.
    <p>
    You must also check the other <code>SEC_&lt;level&gt;_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS</code>
    configuration parameters and ensure that CLAIMTOBE isn't mentioned.
    If the following command doesn't print any output, then you are safe:
    <div style="text-indent: 3em;">
        <pre>condor_config_val -summary | grep -i CLAIMTOBE</pre>
    </div>
