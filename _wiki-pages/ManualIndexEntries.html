   How To Make Index Entries in the Manual
  </h2>
 </span>
 <p>
  Here is a quick summary of how to put index entries into the LaTeX source for the manual. The index itself is automatically generated when the manual is made.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="subsection">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h3>
  Simple index entries
 </h3>
 <p>
  The simplest index entries are of the form
 </p>
 <div class="verbatim">
  <pre>    \index{the entry}
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  This places the string "the entry" into the index, tagged with an appropriate section number (html) or page (pdf), and alphabetized.
 </p>
 <p>
  An index entry that has 2 levels appears as
 </p>
 <div class="verbatim">
  <pre>    \index{main entry!subentry}
</pre>
 </div>
 This alphabetizes the string "main entry" within the index, and then has further entries within that entry. The subentries are also alphabetized.
 <p>
  If you look at the manual's index at the very end, you can see examples that are generated by
 </p>
 <div class="verbatim">
  <pre>    \index{Windows NT!HTCondor daemon names}
    \index{Windows NT!manual install}
</pre>
 </div>
 Note that if any font changes are desired to appear within the index, it gets complicated. LaTeX wants to alphabetize differently, using the fonts as a guide to alphabetical order (not what we want).
 <p>
  <span class="subsection">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h3>
  More complex index entries
 </h3>
 <p>
  If a range of sections (pages) should be in an index entry (as opposed to a single section number or page), then two index entries identify the endpoints of the sections (pages) that are included. The opening entry appears as
 </p>
 <div class="verbatim">
  <pre>    \index{the entry|(}
</pre>
 </div>
 and the closing entry appears as
 <div class="verbatim">
  <pre>    \index{the entry|)}
</pre>
 </div>
 LaTeX gives errors if matching opening and closing entries do not exist.
 <p>
  Again look at the manual's index at the very end, and you will see examples that are generated by
 </p>
 <div class="verbatim">
  <pre>    \index{Windows NT!introduction|(}
    \index{Windows NT!introduction|)}

    \index{Windows NT!release notes|(}
    \index{Windows NT!release notes|)}

    \index{Windows NT!starting the HTCondor service|(}
    \index{Windows NT!starting the HTCondor service|)}
</pre>
 </div>
 <span class="subsection">
  <h3>
   Alphabetization under Font Changes
  </h3>
 </span>
 <p>
  Simplified, if a different font is to be used, but the same alphabetization is desired, an index entry appears of the form
 </p>
 <div class="verbatim">
  <pre>   \index{entry where it should be alphabetically@appearance of entry}
</pre>
 </div>
 The '@' character separates the two parts of this simple index entry. The first part gives the characters that are used for index alphabetization. The second part does whatever is needed to produce a font change.
 <p>
  Here is an example:
 </p>
 <div class="verbatim">
  <pre>\index{daemon!condor\_master@\Condor{master}}
</pre>
 </div>
 Within the index section for "daemon," The string "condor_master" appears italicized, due to the use of the LaTeX macro \Condor{}. However, the alphabetization only uses the string "condor_master" to determine ordering (within the section).
 <p>
  <span class="subsection">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h3>
  Configuration Macros
 </h3>
 <p>
  Index entries for the configuration macros are automatically generated when using the LaTeX macro
 </p>
 <div class="verbatim">
  <pre>   \Macro{macro's name here}
</pre>
 </div>
 There are two entries in the index for each of these macros within the LaTeX source. One places the macro name as the entry. The other uses the configuration variable's name as a subentry under the main entry "configuration macro".
 <p>
  To suppress the automatic generation of index entries, use the LaTeX macro
 </p>
 <div class="verbatim">
  <pre>   \MacroNI{macro's name here}
</pre>
 </div>
 instead of
 <div class="verbatim">
  <pre>   \Macro{macro's name here}
</pre>
 </div>
 The NI stands for No Index.
</div>
