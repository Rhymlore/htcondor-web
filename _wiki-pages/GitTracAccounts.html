   Creating GitTrac Accounts
  </h2>
 </span>
 <p>
  This is the policy for creating gittrac accounts for users outside of the HTCondor Team. Grant accounts to anyone from the community who asks and appears to be a real person - we have an transparent development policy, we just want to keep out spammers and/or misinformers.   To create an account, log into gittrac, select the Users link at the top of the page, then select 'Add User' at the upper-right of the page. Fill in the user's name and e-mail address. The email address must show their affiliation (i.e. no gmail or hotmail addresses). Their gittrac User ID should be the name portion of their e-mail address (the part before the '@').
 </p>
 <p>
  The user should have the following capabilities:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   j Read Wiki
  </li>
  <li>
   k Write Wiki
  </li>
  <li>
   n New Tkt

   o Check-out

  <li>
   p Password
  </li>
  <li>
   r Read
  </li>
  <li>
   w Write
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  They can have the Check-in (i) capability only if we have a signed code contributor license on file.
