  HTCondor is deployed in many environments with many different desired scheduling policies.  To help users create, describe and refine the scheduling policies they would like to implement at their sites, this page is a repository of existing scheduling policies running batch schedulers today.  Information that would identify a particular site has been changed in order to create anonymous information sources.
