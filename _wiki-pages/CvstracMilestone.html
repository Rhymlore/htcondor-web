   Creating A Milestone
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  There are two ways to create a milestone. Once created, milestones can't
currently be deleted.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Manual Method
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  By clicking on the
  <strong>
   Milestone
  </strong>
  link, one can manually create a milestone and
populate each field directly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Repository Method
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  You can create an
  <em>
   Event
  </em>
  milestone using the
  <code>
   cvs rtag
  </code>
  command. The name of
the tag becomes the milestone comment. For example:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <pre>  cvs rtag build_5918 cvstrac
</pre>
 <p>
  will create an
  <em>
   Event
  </em>
  milestone for the
  <code>
   cvstrac
  </code>
  directory with "build_5918"
as the milestone comment.
 </p>

   Using Milestones
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Milestones are mostly useful as markers in various pages, such as the
  <span class="wiki">
   <a href="{{ '/wiki-archive/pages/CvstracTimeline/index.html' | relative_url }}" title="Cvstrac Timeline">
    timeline
   </a>
  </span>
  .
