<div id="content">
 (This needs updating for final nodes.)
 <p>
  A Dag is finished when:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   There are no nodes remaining to submit, all post scripts have completed, the final node has completed.
  </li>
  <li>
   No nodes are queued up and the ready queue is empty.  This implies a cycle in the putative DAG or that something internally in DAGMan is messed up. DAGMan should exit, writing out a rescue DAG.
  </li>
  <li>
   A node has exited with failure and all remaining nodes have a dependency on it completing successfully.  DAGMan should exit, writing out a rescue DAG.
  </li>
 </ol>
</div>
