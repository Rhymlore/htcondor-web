title: Htcondor User Fortune
layout: wiki-page

<div id="content">
 It may be a challenge to get your users to read the HTCondor manual, so you can give them information via the MOTD and the fortune program.
 <p>
  If you do not know how to create a fortune file, a nice tutorial may be found
  <a class="external" href="http://bradthemad.org/tech/notes/fortune_makefile.php">
   here
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Below is the necessary data to put into your text file to generate the fortune. Another good idea is to pull this information from the wiki in a cron job. There are scripts attached to this wiki page that may help.

 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">HTCondor Tip #1:

To see which machines are willing to run jobs now, run:

condor_status -available
%
HTCondor Tip #2:

To see which machines are currently running jobs, run:

condor_status -run
%
HTCondor Tip #3:

To list the machine ClassAds for all machines in the pool, run:

condor_status -l
%
HTCondor Tip #4:

You can allow your job to prefer machines with particular attributes
by adding a 'Rank' command and expression to your submit file.
%
HTCondor Tip #5:

If your standard universe job does not need remote I/O, you may turn
it off by adding the following to your submit file:

want_remote_io = False
%
HTCondor Tip #6:

If you'd like to check on your job while it is running, and you are
using vanilla, java, local, and/or parallel universes, run:

condor_ssh_to_job &lt;job number&gt;
%
HTCondor Tip #7:

If you'd like to use system environment variables in your submit file,
you may specify them using the following:

$ENV{EnvironmentVariableName}
%
HTCondor Tip #8:

If you'd like to use Machine Ad attributes in your submit file so that
you can change behavior based on the machine that will execute your
job, use the Machine Ad substitution macro:

$${MachineAdAttribute}
%
HTCondor Tip #9:

If you'd like a list of all users with jobs submitted, run:

condor_status -submitters
%
HTCondor Tip #10:

To see the list of jobs that you have currently in the submit queue,
run:

condor_q &lt;YourUserName&gt;
%
HTCondor Tip #11:

If all you want to do is have HTCondor run an executable, and do not
need any special features, you probably just need the 'vanilla'
universe.
%
HTCondor Tip #12:

Why is your job not running? To get more information, run:

condor_q -better-analyze &lt;job number&gt;

For HTCondor versions 7.5 and higher, use instead:

condor_q -analyze &lt;job number&gt;
%
HTCondor Tip #13:

Need to see a list of completed jobs? Run:

condor_history
%
HTCondor Tip #14:

Can't quite remember how a particular HTCondor command works? Use
the -help option with the command to get a quick reminder of the
command's usage.
%
HTCondor Tip #15:

If you are interested in running Java applications in the Java
Universe and want to see which machines in the HTCondor pool
support this, run:

condor_status -java
%
HTCondor Tip #16:

Do you have jobs that depend on other jobs to run first? If so,
check out the HTCondor tool "DAGMan" in the manual.
%
HTCondor Tip #17:

If you are concerned about how many jobs may be running at any
time with your DAGMan submission, you can limit the number of
simultaneous jobs with the -maxjobs option.
%
HTCondor Tip #18:

Do you need to visualize your DAG that you created with DAGMan?
DAGMan can output files for use with the 'dot' visualizer. See
the User Manual for specifics.
%
HTCondor Tip #19:

Which version of HTCondor is running on your system? Find out by
running:

condor_version
%
HTCondor Tip #20:

All HTCondor commands have traditional UNIX man pages. To get
help, run:

man &lt;HTCondor command name&gt;
%
HTCondor Tip #21:

Need to sync files back from your Vanilla or Parallel Universe
jobs before they've actually finished? Use rsync and
condor_ssh_to_job.

rsync -v -e condor_ssh_to_job &lt;job number&gt;:&lt;remote filename&gt; &lt;local directory&gt;
