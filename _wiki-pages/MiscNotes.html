 Miscellaneous notes -- possibly some of this stuff should get moved into other sections, but I want to document it as I think of it.

  : these files are for functions used by both condor_submit_dag and condor_dagman itself.  (There are limitations on what can be done in this module so that the link works for both.  For example, you can't call debug_printf() because that's only linked in condor_dagman()).

  Bootstrapping -- see Dag::Bootstrap() -- need to explain that.
