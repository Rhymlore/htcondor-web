     <a class="external" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/manage/bb266240.aspx">

      Access MSDN Managed Newsgroups
     </a>
     . (If you have never used these newsgroups,  then you will need to configure your news reader appropriately:
     <a class="external" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/manage/aa948868.aspx">
      Configure MSDN Managed Newsgroups
     </a>
     . You will only need to do this once.)

  Further Assistance
 </h3>
 <p>
  If after reading this you still can't find what you are looking for, then
  <a class="external" href="http://www.google.com/">
   Google.com
  </a>
  et al. may be your only recourse.  You might also try asking other team members, like Ben (if he is still around),  if they have any experience or insight into your problem, or you could even try using one of the many public newsgroups.  If those are of no use, then maybe visiting some web-sites like
  <a class="external" href="http://www.codeproject.com/">
   CodeProject.com
  </a>
  or
  <a class="external" href="http://www.codeguru.com/">
   CodeGuru.com
  </a>
  may help.
