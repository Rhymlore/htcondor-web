 have a compatibility version of this method, but it has several deficiencies.
 <p>
  First, it doesn't print attributes from the chained ad.
 </p>
 <p>
  Second, it doesn't omit private attributes when necessary. It also doesn't encrypt them when appropriate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Third, it doesn't have the optional addition of the
  <span class="quote">
   ServerTime
  </span>
  attribute.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fourth, it doesn't convert local IP addresses in attribute values to that of the open socket (using ConvertDefaultIPToSocketIP()).
 </p>
 <p>
  Fifth, it doesn't emulate AttrList::put(), which doesn't send the
  <span class="quote">
   MyType
  </span>
  and
  <span class="quote">
   TargetType
  </span>
  attributes after the other attributes. There is a standalone function that does this (putOldClassAdNoTypes()). Clarification: putOldClassAdNoTypes() doesn't send the
  <span class="quote">
   MyType
  </span>
  or
  <span class="quote">
   TargetType
  </span>
  after other attributes.
