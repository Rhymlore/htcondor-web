  CVSTrac Attachments
 </strong>
 <p>
  CVSTrac allows arbitrary files to be attached to any
  <span class="wiki">
   <a href="{{ '/wiki-archive/pages/CvstracWiki/index.html' | relative_url }}" title="Cvstrac Wiki">
    wiki
   </a>
  </span>
  and
  <span class="wiki">
   <a href="{{ '/wiki-archive/pages/CvstracTicket/index.html' | relative_url }}" title="Cvstrac Ticket">
    ticket
   </a>
  </span>
  pages.
 </p>
 <p>
  Attachments to a page are generally listed near the bottom of the page.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong class="two">
   Attaching a File
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Assuming you have proper permissions, clicking on an
  <strong>
   Attach
  </strong>
  link in a wiki or
ticket page will send you to an upload form. Choose the file from your local
disk and, optionally, add a
  <span class="wiki">
   <a href="{{ '/wiki-archive/pages/FormattingWikiPages/index.html' | relative_url }}" title="Formatting Wiki Pages">
    wiki-formatted
   </a>
  </span>
  description. Then upload.
 </p>
 <p>
  Note that any provided description cannot be editted after uploading.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each uploaded attachment is internally assigned a unique identifier. As such,
you can upload the same filename multiple times to as many places as you'd
like, as many times as you'd like.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maximum attachments sizes are
configurable. The default is usually 100k.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong class="two">
   Getting Attachments
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Uploaded attachments can be downloaded simply by clicking on the link in the
listing. CVSTrac preserves the original MIME type so as long as the uploader
got that part right things like special viewers should be automatically
launched by the browser.
 </p>
 <p>
  Image attachments may also be inlined by the attachment filename with
  <span class="quote">
   {image:}
  </span>
  markups. Note that if the same filename was uploaded multiple
times the results are undefined.
