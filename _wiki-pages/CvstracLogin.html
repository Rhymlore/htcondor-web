which needs extra permissions.

CVSTrac tracks your IP address. User behind proxies using variable addresses
will have serious difficulty using CVSTrac sites.

   User Pages
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Recent versions of CVSTrac have introduced user home pages. Basically, each
user can have a personal
  <span class="wiki">
   <a href="{{ '/wiki-archive/pages/CvstracWiki' | relative_url }}" title="Cvstrac Wiki">
    wiki page
   </a>
  </span>
  . Once a user creates
such a page, his or her name will become a hotlink back to the page in various
places such as the
  <span class="wiki">
   <a href="{{ '/wiki-archive/pages/CvstracTimeline' | relative_url }}" title="Cvstrac Timeline">
    timeline
   </a>
  </span>
  . This page can be used as a
personal scratchpad or can include embedded reports relevant to the user.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once the user is logged in, they're user name in the upper left corner becomes
a link to their page.
