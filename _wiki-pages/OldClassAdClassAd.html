 Four versions of the constructor are called by outside code:
 <ul>
  <li>
   ClassAd()
  </li>
  <li>
   ClassAd(FILE*,char*,int&amp;,int&amp;,int&amp;)
  </li>
  <li>
   ClassAd(char *, char)
  </li>
  <li>
   ClassAd(const ClassAd&amp;)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The underlying
  <span class="quote">
   AttrList
  </span>
  constructors are called in some locations.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first version has a direct equivalent in new
  <span class="quote">
   ClassAds
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The second version has a compatibility version in new
  <span class="quote">
   ClassAds
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The third version has no equivalent in new
  <span class="quote">
   ClassAds
  </span>
  . There are two callsites. One (ClassAdCollection::GetClassAdRank()) is trivial to rewrite to construct the ad differently. The other (HookPrepareJobClient::hookExited()) can be rewritten in a few hours.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fourth version has a direct equivalent in new
  <span class="quote">
   ClassAds
  </span>
  .
