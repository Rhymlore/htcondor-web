<div id="content">
 HTCondor assumes that all floating point numbers are of the form x.y, which,
depending on a computer's current locale, may not always be the case. This
problem occurs even if HTCondor is running under an account that has had the
locale configured correctly.  The problem lies in the template user account
which is used to create HTCondor's dynamic accounts. Even if the entire
system is configured to use a new locale, this template account seems to
retain the original system locale. The following steps can be used fix
this problem.
 <p>
  To create a default user profile, you must be logged on as
Administrator or be a member of the Administrators group.
Create a new user profile for all new user accounts on a computer to be
based on. To create subsequent profiles, you can use the new user account
as a template. Here is how to use the new user profile as a template account
to use as a new user's profile:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Log on to the computer as the new user, and customize the
desktop if appropriate.
  </li>
  <li>
   Optionally, install and configure any applications to be shared
by user accounts made from this template.
  </li>
  <li>
   Log off, and then log on as the Administrator.
  </li>
  <li>
   In the Control Panel}, open the System Control Panel
 applet.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  *: On Vista click on the
 Advanced system settings Task listed in the left pane.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   On the Advanced tab, under User Profiles,
click Settings.
  </li>
  <li>
   Under Profiles stored on this computer, select the user
you created to be the template, and then click Copy To}.
  </li>
  <li>
   To create the default user profile for the computer, type the path
to the default user:
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  *: On Windows 2000: %WinDir%\Profiles\Default;
 *: On Windows XP: %SystemDrive%\Documents and Settings\Defualt;
 *: On Vista: %SystemDrive%\Users\Default.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   In the Copy To dialog box, under Permitted to use,
click Change.
  </li>
  <li>
   In the Select User or Group dialog box, in the
Enter the object name to select text box, type: Everyone
and click OK.
  </li>
  <li>
   Click OK to dismiss the Copy To dialog box.
  </li>
  <li>
   Click OK again to dismiss the User Profiles dialog box.
  </li>
  <li>
   Finally, click OK one last time to dismiss the
System Properties dialog.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  If HTCondor has already created some dynamic accounts, you will need to remove
them so that HTCondor can re-create them with the new template account.
