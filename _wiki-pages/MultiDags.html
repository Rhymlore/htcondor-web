  Because there's no requirement that all nodes in a given DAG file be connected, it's pretty simple to allow multiple DAG files to be run by a single DAGMan invocation.  The main issue is making sure that you don't have name collisions between nodes in different DAG files (if there are name collisions
  <em>
   within
  </em>
  a DAG file, that's a user error...).
 </p>
 <p>
  To avoid the name collision problem, we simply rename the nodes (add details here).
 </p>
 <p>
  Once parsing has happened, we no longer have any record of which DAG file a given node came from -- essentially we have a DAG structure that could be created by a single DAG file with appropriate node names.  One consequence of this is that, if a rescue DAG is generated, we get a single rescue DAG file that incorporates information for the
  <em>
   entire
  </em>
  structure corresponding to all of the input files.
