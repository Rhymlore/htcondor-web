title: How To Avoid Email Per Job

<div id="content">
 Generally you shouldn't ignore all of the mail HTCondor sends,
but you can reduce the amount you get by telling HTCondor that you don't
want to be notified every time a job successfully completes, only when
a job experiences an error.
To do this, include a line in your submit file like the following:
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">Notification = Error
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  See the Notification parameter in the condor_q man page on for more information.
 </p>
</div>
