title: Full Port Log Debian Eight
layout: wiki-page
---
<div id="content">
 I installed
 <code>
  uuid-dev
 </code>
 ,
 <code>
  libkrb5-dev
 </code>
 (may be optional in the future, once Jaime fixes the build to use its own Globus),
 <code>
  gcc-4.8
 </code>
 (not, I don't know why
 <code>
  glibc
 </code>
 doesn't like 4.9, either),
 <code>
  gawk
 </code>
 ,
 <code>
  texinfo
 </code>
 , and
 <code>
  gcc-multilib
 </code>
 .
 <p>
  Debian 8 uses the same glibc version as Ubuntu.  It would probably be marginally more likely to be compatible to use Debian's version on Ubuntu rather than vice-versa, but since everything tested OK I'm not going to worry about it.

 <p>
  Reminder: you need to activate the (64-bit only) "LIGO" test specifically for each platform in the
  <code>
   condor_tests
  </code>
  directory.
 </p>
 <p>
  This port was performed against a pre-release version of Debian 8; our scripts recognize it as "Debian-" or "x86_64_Debian0" instead of "Debian-8" or "x86_64_Debian8"; we should probably remove the former when we upgrade the build machine to the full release.  See the commit message for files with the screwy names.
