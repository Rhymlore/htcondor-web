  There are several native package repositories containing builds of HTCondor.  One is the "daily" repository, which contains a snapshot of the codebase as it stands in the past 24 hours (assuming automated regression testing did not fail).  These are
  <strong>
   not
  </strong>
  official releases, and are intended just for testing and development.
