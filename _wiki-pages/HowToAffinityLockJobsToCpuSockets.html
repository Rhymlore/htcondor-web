  How to bind multi-core Condor jobs to only run in one CPU socket
 </strong>
 <p>
  Known to work with HTCondor version: 8.2.8
 </p>
 <p>
  Some multicore jobs are very sensitive to CPU cache performance, and have huge slowdowns if threads run on cores located on separate physical CPU cores on the same machine.
 </p>
 <p>
  This slowdown can be so severe that some sites would rather have multi-core jobs sit idle rather than be scheduled to run across physical cores.
 </p>
 <p>
  Condor can do this with static slots in a straight forward way.  For partitionable slots, one can create one p-slot per physical cpu socket, and affinity lock the set of cores on those socket to those slots.  Assume a two socket machine, with two cores per socket.  Socket one has core ids 0 and 1, Socket two has core ids 2 and 3.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code"># Assume two sockets per machine
NUM_SLOTS_TYPE_1 = 2
SLOT_TYPE_1_PARTITIONABLE = true

# This example has 2 cores per socket
SLOT_TYPE_1 = cpus=2

# Turn on CPU affinity in condor
ENFORCE_CPU_AFFINITY = true

# Bind the cores to each slot -- note that you must figure out how your particular cpu numbers their cores and sockets.  I don't think this is standard, and I'm not sure how hyperthreads (if enabled) count.
SLOT1_CPU_AFFINITY=0,1
SLOT2_CPU_AFFINITY=2,3
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  To determine which core ids are bound to which sockets, the following perl script can be run.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">
$ perl -lne '
  $ARGV =~ m{/cpu(\d+)/};
  push @{$p{$_}}, $1;
  END {print "socket $_: ", join ",", sort {$a&lt;=&gt;$b} @{$p{$_}} for sort {$a&lt;=&gt;$b} keys %p}
' /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/topology/physical_package_id
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  Whose output might look like:
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">
socket 0: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23
socket 1: 8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31

</pre>
 </div>
