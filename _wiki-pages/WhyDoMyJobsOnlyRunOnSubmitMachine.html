title: Why Do My Jobs Only Run On Submit Machine
layout: wiki-page

<div id="content">
 HTCondor will only send jobs from a submit machine to a remote execute machine if it has been told that the two machines share a common file system, or if file transfer is enabled.  If you have this problem, try setting the following lines in your submit file to enable file transfer:
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">should_transfer_files = yes
when_to_transfer_output = on_exit
transfer_input_files = file_to_transfer1, another_file_to_transfer, and_so_on
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  Note that the executable is included by default in the file transfer list.
 </p>
</div>
