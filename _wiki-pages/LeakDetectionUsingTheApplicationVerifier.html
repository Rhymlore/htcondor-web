  Introduction
 </h2>
 <p>
  What follows is an exhaustive tutorial demonstrating ways which a developer can indentify resource leaks in a process.  We use a tool called
  <span class="wiki">
   <a class="missing" href="{{ '/wiki-archive/pages/LeakDiag' | relative_url }}" title="Leak Diag">
    LeakDiag
   </a>
  </span>
  from Microsoft.  This tool allows us to see the changes in processes' resource consumption over time. In some cases, a processes' resource consumption may grow in an unbounded manner. A resource leak may be responsible for this behavior. The rest of this document is devoted to identifying these incorrect behaviors and when they may be a problem.

  So, unlike
  <code>
   umdh.exe
  </code>
  ,
  <span class="quote">
   LeakDiag

  can detect all possible resource leaks in a Windows environment.  To do this it uses Microsoft's
  <a class="external" href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/detours/">
   Detours
  </a>
  library, which can hook any system or library call and replace it with its own.
