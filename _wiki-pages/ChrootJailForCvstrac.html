 <strong>
  Launching CVSTrac Into A Chroot Jail
 </strong>
 <p>
  CVSTrac will automatically put itself into a chroot jail if its
first argument is
  <em>
   chroot
  </em>
  and it is started as root.  After the
  <strong>
   chroot
  </strong>
  argument, the next two arguments are the directory which
should be the new root directory and the user that the program
should run as after it is chrooted.  (CVSTrac always drops any superuser
privileges before doing any real work, regardless of whether or not
you use the
  <strong>
   chroot
  </strong>
  option.)  After the
  <em>
   chroot
  </em>
  argument and its
two parameters, the usual
  <strong>
   cgi
  </strong>
  or
  <strong>
   http
  </strong>
  keyword and its arguments
appear.
 </p>
 <p>
  For the
  <a class="external" href="http://cvs.hwaci.com:2080/cvstrac/">
   http://cvs.hwaci.com:2080/cvstrac/
  </a>
  site, CVSTrac is run from
inetd.  The inetd.conf configuration line looks like this:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <pre>  2080 steam tcp nowait.1000 root /usr/bin/cvstrac \
       cvstrac chroot /home/cvs cvs http /
</pre>
 <p>
  The three arguments
  <strong>
   chroot /home/cvs cvs
  </strong>
  tell the server to put
itself into a chroot jail located at
  <strong>
   /home/cvs
  </strong>
  and drop superuser
privilege and become user
  <strong>
   cvs
  </strong>
  before continuing.  The first three
arguments are then removed and processing continues as if the
command had been launched as
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <pre>  cvstrac http /
</pre>
 <p>
  Notice that the directory argument to the
  <em>
   http
  </em>
  directive, the argument
that tells CVSTrac where to look for its database, is specified
relative to the chroot jail, not to the regular filesystem.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Configuring The Jail
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  CVSTrac does a popen() of a few commands for some of its operations.
It uses the following external programs:
  <strong>
   rlog rcsdiff co.
  </strong>
  The popen() procedure uses /bin/sh and rcsdiff uses diff.
All of these external programs most be available inside the chroot
jail.  In addition, CVSTrac needs to access a stripped-down version
of /etc/passwd at one point.  It also needs access to the /tmp
directory and to the special file /dev/null.  The /etc/localhost
file is optional, but without it, all times are shown in UTC.
 </p>
 <p>
  The following listing shows all the files and directories in the chroot jail
for the canonical CVSTrac installation:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <pre>  bin
  bin/sh
  bin/bash
  dev
  dev/null
  etc
  etc/localtime
  etc/passwd
  lib
  lib/libc.so.6
  lib/ld-linux.so.2
  lib/libtermcap.so.2
  tmp
  usr
  usr/bin
  usr/bin/rcsdiff
  usr/bin/co
  usr/bin/rlog
  usr/bin/diff
</pre>
 <p>
  A similar set of files will be required in any chroot jail for
CVSTrac, though the details may vary.  For example, the required
libraries might change.  Or you might use a different shell.
(The bin/sh above is a hard link to bin/bash)
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Setup Changes
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  After you get CVSTrac running inside a chroot jail, you'll need to log in
as the "setup" user, go to the "setup" page, and change the path to the
CVS repository and the log file so that they are relative to the chroot
jail not the regular filesystem.  Other than that, though, no additional
setup changes are required.
