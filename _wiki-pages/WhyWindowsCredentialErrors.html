<div id="content">
 Jobs submitted from a Windows machine require a stashed password in
order for HTCondor to perform certain operations on the user's behalf.
RThe command which stashes a password for a user
is condor_store_cred.  See the manual page for usage details.
 <p>
  The error message that HTCondor gives if a user has not stashed a
password is of the form:
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">ERROR: No credential stored for username@machinename

        Correct this by running:
            condor_store_cred add
</pre>
 </div>
</div>
