<div id="content">
 New

  ClassAds
 </span>
 provide an iterator via the begin() and end() methods to traverse all of the attributes in the ad. The iterator doesn't handle any chained ad.
 <p>
  One callsite is in Quill's jobqueuecollection.cpp. This site may require handling of chained ads.
 </p>
 <p>
  One difference between old
  <span class="quote">
   ClassAds
  </span>
  ' NextExpr() and new
  <span class="quote">
   ClassAds
  </span>
  ' iterator is that the former returns an
  <span class="quote">
   ExprTree
  </span>
  of the assignment operator (including attribute name and value) while the latter returns an
  <span class="quote">
   ExprTree
  </span>
  of just the attribute value. This shouldn't be a problem, as all of the callsites immediately use the
  <span class="quote">
   ExprTree
  </span>
  to either copy into a new ad or unparse into a string.
 </p>
 <p>
  Developer time: half day to examine jobqueuecollection.cpp, plus 1-2 weeks student time to update callsites
