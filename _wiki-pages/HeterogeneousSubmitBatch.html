title: Heterogeneous Submit Batch

<div id="content">
 Here are two methods for enabling heterogeneous submission of jobs.  These are jobs that may run on a variety of platforms, such as both Windows and Linux.

 <h3>
  If Perl is available on all execute hosts
 </h3>
 <p>
  A single batch script can be defined to work on all Windows and Linux machines.  If Perl is available on all potential execute machines, then depend on it, and write a Perl batch script.  Name the script with the extension
  <code>
   .pl
  </code>
  , and Windows machines will use this extension to identify and run it as a Perl script. The first line of the Perl script will have
  <code>
   #!
  </code>
  , letting Linux machines know what to do.

 <h3>
  TJ's shabang hack
 </h3>
 <p>
  Three parts to this set up make it work:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Create a small Windows console application that returns 0. Name this application
   <code>
    #!.exe
   </code>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Here is C++ source, assuming it is named
   <code>
    success.cpp
   </code>
   , that can be compiled to produce
   <code>
    #!.exe
   </code>
   :
   <div class="code">
    <pre class="code">// Force the linker to include KERNEL32.LIB
#pragma comment(linker, "/defaultlib:kernel32.lib")
extern "C" void __stdcall ExitProcess(unsigned int uExitCode);
extern "C" void __cdecl begin( void ) { ExitProcess(0); }
</pre>
   </div>
   <br/>
   This code could be compiled with the Microsoft C++ compiler like this
   <div class="verbatim">
    <pre>  cl success.cpp /link /subsystem:console /entry:begin kernel32.lib
</pre>
   </div>
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Send file
   <code>
    #!.exe
   </code>
   along with the job.
Assuming that this file is in the current working directory at
submission, the submit description file will contain
   <div class="code">
    <pre class="code">  should_transfer_files = IF_NEEDED
  transfer_input_files = #!.exe
</pre>
   </div>
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   The following batch script, named with a
   <code>
    .bat
   </code>
   extension,
becomes the executable:
   <div class="code">
    <pre class="code">#!/bin/bash
#!&amp;&amp; @goto windows_part

echo 'Linux'
ls -l

exit 0
:windows_part
@echo off

@echo Windows
dir

</pre>
   </div>
   <br/>
   On Linux, this works as a normal bash script; the
   <code>
    exit 0
   </code>
   stops the script before it gets to the label
   <code>
    windows_part
   </code>
   .
What Windows sees is a
   <code>
    .bat
   </code>
   file, so it runs in the command shell.
The first line is
   <code>
    #!/bin/bash
   </code>
   ,
and Windows interprets that line as:
   <em>
    run the program
   </em>
   <code>
    #!.exe
   </code>
   <em>
    and pass it
   </em>
   <code>
    /bin/bash
   </code>
   <em>
    as arguments.
   </em>
   The second line is
   <code>
    #!&amp;&amp; @goto windows_part
   </code>
   ,
which Windows interprets  as:
   <em>
    run the program
   </em>
   <code>
    #!
   </code>
   ,
   <em>
    and if it succeeds,
goto the
   </em>
   <code>
    windows_part
   </code>
   <em>
    label in this script.
   </em>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  So, you have one script, that contains both Linux and Windows commands.
It works on Windows as long as you have the program named
  <code>
   #!.exe
  </code>
  in the current directory (or in the path) that returns success.
