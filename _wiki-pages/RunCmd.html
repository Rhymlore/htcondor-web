  runcmd for system calls
 </strong>
 <p>
  This call is a robust tool for passing requests not to
"system" from Perl but to "IPC::Open3::open3";
 </p>
 <p>
  Everything you need to use it is in CondorUtils.pm
and a sample usage script is in condor_tests/run_cmd.pl.
It is used in all the key testing Perl modules and batch_test.pl
 </p>
 <p>
  Calling it in its basic form is only different from "system"
in spelling:
 </p>
 <p>
  system("ps -ef");
  <br/>
  runcmd("ps -ef");
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  However the behavior is quite different as is the return. Runcmd
takes an optional hash after the string allowing you to control
its default behaviors. Additionally it returns a reference to a hash
containing an assortment of things.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is an alternate calling method. For places already expecting
to check the return code you can still use it by calling:
 </p>
 <p>
  my $ret = verbose_system("ps -ef");
 </p>
 <p>
  Both of these function accept an optional hash of args.
 </p>
 <p>
  The four default behaviors and their defaults are:
 </p>
 <p>
  expect_result                      PASS
  <br/>
  die_on_failed_expectation          TRUE
  <br/>
  emit_output                        TRUE
  <br/>
  use_system                         FALSE
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  There are a number of predefined results which you can pass in
in this form:
 </p>
 <p>
  runcmd("ls",{expect_result=&gt;\&amp;FAIL});
 </p>
 <p>
  PASS, FAIL, ANY, SIGNALED or SIGNAL.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you'd like it quiet unless there is a failed expectation....
 </p>
 <p>
  runcmd("ls",{expect_result=&gt;\&amp;FAIL,emit_output=&gt;0});
 </p>
 <p>
  Returns a reference to a hash filled as follows:
 </p>
 <p>
  $returnthings{"signal"} = $signal;
  <br/>
  $returnthings{"success"} = $rc;
  <br/>
  $returnthings{"exitcode"} = $rc;
  <br/>
  $returnthings{"stdout"} = \@outlines;
  <br/>
  $returnthings{"stderr"} = \@errlines;
  <br/>
  $returnthings{"expectation"} = $expected;
  <br/>
 </p>
