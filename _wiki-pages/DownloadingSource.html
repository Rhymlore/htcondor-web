 Each public release of HTCondor makes available on the HTCondor web site's
 <a class="external" href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/downloads-v2/download.pl">
  download page
 </a>
 both binaries (built on numerous platforms) and source code - just select a version, then place a check box next to
 <code>
  HTCondor Source
 </code>
 to download the source code used to build that version of HTCondor.
 <p>
  Alternatively, if you are familiar with the git revision control system, you can grab source code directly from a continuously updated git repository.  Assuming you have git installed on your system, the following command will clone a repository containing the HTCondor source code including both the development (master branch) and stable release branches:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <pre>   git clone http://condor-git.cs.wisc.edu/repos/condor.git
</pre>
 <p>
  Be patient, the source is big - cloning can take a while. Alternatively, the HTCondor source code repository is also mirrored at
  <span class="quote">
   GitHub
  </span>
  , enabling
  <span class="quote">
   GitHub
  </span>
  users to easily fork the HTCondor source in order to do revision-controlled development of experimental features.  The
  <span class="quote">
   GitHub
  </span>
  URL is:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <pre>   <a class="external" href="https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor">https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor</a>
</pre>
 <p>
  A great way to follow HTCondor development is by looking at the Timeline for this wiki, which gives a daily summary of what code or tickets changed (also available as an RSS feed).  The Timeline is available by clicking
  <code>
   [Timeline]
  </code>
  at the top of this page, or directly via URL:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <pre>   <a class="external" href="https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/timeline">https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/timeline</a>
</pre>
 <p>
  Another way to follow development is via Gitweb, a web portal into the source code repository, available via URL:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <pre>   <a class="external" href="http://condor-git.cs.wisc.edu/">http://condor-git.cs.wisc.edu/</a></pre>
