  Installation and Configuration
 </h2>
 <p>
  Martin Kandes wrote excellent instructions on installing and configuring
  <code>
   condor_annex
  </code>
  :
  <a class="external" href="http://www.t2.ucsd.edu/twiki2/bin/view/UCSDTier2/Condor_annex">
   http://www.t2.ucsd.edu/twiki2/bin/view/UCSDTier2/Condor_annex
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  First-time users should:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Follow steps 1-3 as written
  </li>
  <li>
   Skip step 4, and just use the 'us-east-1' region.
  </li>
  <li>
   Follow steps 5&amp;6 as written
  </li>
  <li>
   Skip step 7, and just use the [FIXME] AMI
  </li>
  <li>
   Follow steps 8-9
  </li>
  <li>
   Instead of step 10, please obtain the most recent version of
   <code>
    condor_annex
   </code>
   from [FIXME]
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Everyone should then follow the instructions below ("set the default launch configurations").
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="subsection">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h3>
  Set the default launch configurations.
 </h3>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Go to your list of Auto Scaling group launch configurations:
   <a class="external" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/autoscaling/home?region=us-east-1#LaunchConfigurations">
    https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/autoscaling/home?region=us-east-1#LaunchConfigurations
   </a>
   :
  </li>
  <li>
   If you don't have any Auto Scaling groups, you'll have to (temporarily) create one in order to create a Launch Configuration; click the
   <strong>
    Create Auto Scaling group
   </strong>
   button.
  </li>
  <li>
   Click the
   <strong>
    Create launch configuration
   </strong>
   button in the lower-right.
  </li>
  <li>
   Select "Community AMIs" from the tabs on the left.  Enter "FIXME" and hit the
   <strong>
    Select
   </strong>
   button to choose the default AMI.
  </li>
  <li>
   Select an instance type from the list.  If you just created a new account, the "t2.micro" type may be free.  Otherwise, "m3.large" is a nice, simple choice.
  </li>
  <li>
   Click the
   <strong>
    Configure details
   </strong>
   button.
  </li>
  <li>
   For HTCondor to find this launch configuration, it
   <em>
    must
   </em>
   be named "HTCondorAnnex1".
  </li>
  <li>
   If you're not able to use AWS' free tier, the cheapest way to experiment is the Spot instances; see FIXME for details.  The simplest way (because you instances won't vanish unexpectedly) is without Spot instances.
  </li>
  <li>
   Click the the
   <em>
    5. Configure Security Group
   </em>
   link at the top.
  </li>
  <li>
   Click "Select an
   <strong>
    existing
   </strong>
   security group" and make sure the default security group (or the security you created) is selected.
  </li>
  <li>
   Hit the
   <strong>
    Review
   </strong>
   button.
  </li>
  <li>
   Hit the
   <strong>
    Create launch configuration
   </strong>
   button.
  </li>
  <li>
   Select the EC2 keypair you created in step 5 of Martin Kandes' instructions.
  </li>
  <li>
   Click the acknowledgement and the
   <strong>
    Create launch configuration
   </strong>
   button.
  </li>
  <li>
   Now hit the "Cancel" link at the bottom --
   <code>
    condor_annex
   </code>
   will create the autoscaling group(s) you need for you.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  You only need one launch configuration to get started, but if you want to another instance types later, just change the name to "HTCondorAnnex2".
  <code>
   condor_annex
  </code>
  will recognize and use up to "HTCondorAnnex8".
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="section">

 <h2>
  Start an Annex
 </h2>
 <p>
  The minimal set of options to start an annex follows:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="term">
  <pre class="term">$ condor_annex --project-id MyFirstAnnex --instances 3 --expiry "2017-01-20 17:18:19"
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  <em>
   [The collector address and the password file path are both extracted from the command environment's HTCondor configuration.  The password file is uploaded to a private S3 bucket managed by condor_annex; the location is passed into the custom AMI via the usual instance contextualization methods.]
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  This command will return after HTCondor has set up the lease and requested that Amazon start 3 instances of the type(s) you specified.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   [The tool allows you to create a set of default launch configurations, so you don't have to type them in every time, but specifying an example type on the command-line is a much faster way to get started.]
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  It will take a few minutes for the annex's slots to show up, but they will be assigned in the next negotiation cycle (which may also take a few minutes), and your jobs will start running shortly after that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="section">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h2>
  Monitor your Annex
 </h2>
 <p>
  The following command line will print out the usual
  <code>
   condor_status
  </code>
  information for the annex you specify:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="term">
  <pre class="term">$ condor_status -annex MyFirstAnnex
ip-172-31-48-84.ec2.internal  LINUX      X86_64 Claimed   Busy      0.640 3767
ip-172-31-54-121.ec2.internal LINUX      X86_64 Claimed   Busy      0.880 3767
ip-172-31-56-45.ec2.internal  LINUX      X86_64 Claimed   Busy      0.600 3767

        Total    11     0      11         0       0          0        0      0
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="restricted">
  <i>
   [This is entirely equivalent to
  </i>
  <tt>
   condor_status -const 'AnnexName =?= MyFirstAnnex'
  </tt>
  <i>
   so it should be easy to implement.]
  </i>
 </div>
 In this case, all three of the slots you requested have already started to run jobs.
 <p>
  <span class="section">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h2>
  Stop an Annex
 </h2>
 <p>
  If you're already familiar with the
  <code>
   condor_off
  </code>
  command, you can use it to turn off HTCondor on the annex nodes; the default image is configured so that this will also shut down the machine.  To shut down each machine in an annex, use the following command-line:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="term">
  <pre class="term">$ condor_off -annex MyFirstAnnex
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="restricted">
  <i>
   [This is entirely equivalent to
  </i>
  <tt>
   condor_off -const 'AnnexName =?= MyFirstAnnex'
  </tt>
  <i>
   so it should be easy to implement.]
  </i>
 </div>
</div>
