 Ben (26 Nov 2008) - From a brief look at the code, is seems that the firewall code looks for the current firewall profile using a simple sleep(10*1000) as a
polling interval, as you suggested, which it tries WINDOWS_FIREWALL_FAILURE_RETRY times (which defaults to 60 itself) which is 10*1000*60 milliseconds, or 10 minutes. So, if the firewall is off, this would account for the consistent delay in startup.
 <p>
  Result - Start/restart HTCondor on Windows more quickly: WINDOWS_FIREWALL_IS_OFF=TRUE
