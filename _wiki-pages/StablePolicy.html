<div id="content">
 The HTCondor stable series is updated with only bug fixes and new platform ports. Backward compatibility is strictly maintained except for potential security fixes.
 <p>
  The stable series can receive new features on an exception basis. Exceptions are rare.
 </p>
 <p>
  Any potentially destabilizing changes to the stable series must be raised to a group of project maintainers - currently Todd Tannenbaum (CHTC) and Matthew Farrellee (Red Hat) - who will agree on a course of action. No action should be taken until it is approved by the maintainers.
 </p>

  Who can raise an exception to the maintainers?
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Anyone who is potentially making a destabilizing change (proactive)
  </li>
  <li>
   Anyone who sees a destabilizing change (reactive)
