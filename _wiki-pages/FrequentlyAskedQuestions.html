  <em>
   Question:
  </em>
  I don't want CVSTrac to change my CVSROOT/passwd file. How do I keep it
from changing that file when I add new users to CVSTrac?
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Answer:
  </em>
  CVSTrac will not change the CVSROOT/passwd file if you turn off
write permission on that file.  There is also an option under
the Setup menu that an administrator can use to turn off CVSROOT/passwd
writing.

  <em>
   Question:
  </em>
  I have multiple projects in the same CVS repository.  How can I set
of separate CVSTrac instances for each project?
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Answer:
  </em>
  There is an option under the Setup menu that will cause CVSTrac to
ignore all files whose names do not match a specified prefix.
If all of your projects have distinct prefixes, you can use this
option to restrict each CVSTrac instance to a single project.
