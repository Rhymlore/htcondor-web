<div id="content">
 We archive releases in both binary and source form to DVD. They're stored in paper sleeves in a set of black CD boxes. Write the release number on the envelope to make it easy to find them. The unused sleeves themselves are stores in one of the boxes; at the moment they're being used as a spacer to keep the DVDs from falling over.

  From Alan's perspective, random students occasionally show up and have over DVDs (sans envelopes). I suspect Tim T already knows what's happened prior to that.
