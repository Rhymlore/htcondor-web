   Executive summary
  </h2>
 </span>
 <p>
  The public git repositories served up on
  <a class="external" href="http://condor-git.cs.wisc.edu">
   gitweb
  </a>
  are maintained by a simple script, called
  <code>
   git-mirror.rb
  </code>
  .  This script pulls all heads matching certain patterns from the internal repository.  By default, branches fitting the following criteria will be mirrored:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   the master branch (
   <code>
    master
   </code>
   ),
  </li>
  <li>
   standard nightly build tags, of the form
   <code>
    YYYY-M[M]-D[D][_X*]
   </code>
   ,
  </li>
  <li>
   branches whose names end with
   <code>
    -publicbranch
   </code>
   ,
  </li>
  <li>
   nightly build tags that end with
   <code>
    -publicbranch
   </code>
   and a build date,
  </li>
  <li>
   release tags, and
  </li>
  <li>
   explicitly whitelisted branches (currently
   <code>
    V7_5-dcloud-branch
   </code>
   and
   <code>
    V7_1-procd_osg-branch
   </code>
   )
  </li>
 </ol>

  Frequently-asked questions
 </h2>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Where is all of this stuff?
  </strong>
  See
  <code>
   pinguino:/scratch.2/git
  </code>
  for the scripts and the gitweb installation.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   How often does this thing run?
  </strong>
  The old shell-script version ran once every twenty minutes as a cron job.  The new Ruby version pulls all matching branches, sleeps for thirty seconds, and then runs itself again; it uses cron essentially as a watchdog.  (That is, at most one mirror job targeting a given destination repository will run at a time.)
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   When should I expect to see my changes to a mirrored branch reflected in the public repository?
  </strong>
  A pull shouldn't take more than five minutes, so the worst-case scenario for the new mirror script is probably under ten minutes.  (The real worst-case scenario involves waiting for the cron job to restart
  <code>
   git-mirror.rb
  </code>
  , but your average wait time in that case should still be under fifteen minutes.)
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   How can I tell if my (sensitive) branch will be mirrored to the public repository?
  </strong>
  You can run
  <code>
   git-mirror.rb
  </code>
  yourself on your personal repo with the
  <code>
   --dry-run
  </code>
  option, and it will show you the list of branches and tags it would have pushed, given the default options.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   How can I tell if my (non-sensitive) branch will be mirrored to the public repository?
  </strong>
  Push it to the main internal repo and wait for at most fifteen minutes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   How can I recognize an additional set of branch or tag names to be mirrored to the public repository?
  </strong>
  The first question to ask yourself is "do I really need to do this?"  Unless you're dealing with something inflexible that expects a certain kind of branch or tag name, it's better to use a name that already fits one of the existing patterns.  However, it's easy to make the script recognize additional patterns:  simply specify the additional pattern as a command-line argument to
  <code>
   git-mirror.rb
  </code>
  in the crontab entry:  use
  <code>
   -p REGEX
  </code>
  to specify that head names matching
  <code>
   REGEX
  </code>
  should be pushed or
  <code>
   -w NAME
  </code>
  to add
  <code>
   NAME
  </code>
  to the name whitelist.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   What else can I do with this script?
  </strong>
  Glad you asked!  Run
  <code>
   git-mirror.rb --help
  </code>
  for more details.
