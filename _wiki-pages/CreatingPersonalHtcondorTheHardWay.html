 <h3>
  Building HTCondor
 </h3>
 <p>
  Note this section is optional -- if you are on a CSL machine, you can skip to the "Settting up your Personal HTCondor" section
 </p>
 <p>
  Pretend you have your build in
  <code>
   /scratch/roy/v66
  </code>
  .
Pretend you have you want to set up a personal HTCondor in
  <code>
   /scratch/roy/personal-condor
  </code>
  .
Substitute pathnames appropriately.
 </p>
 <p>
  First, build HTCondor as described in
  <span class="wiki">
   <a href="{{ '/wiki-archive/pages/BuildingHtcondorOnUnix/index.html' | relative_url }}" title="Building Htcondor On Unix">
    here
   </a>
  </span>
  . After you run make, do "make install" (note: in older versions of the code, this used to be "make release"). You'll find that you have a new directory
  <code>
   /scratch/roy/v66/release_dir
  </code>
  , and if you look inside it, you will see something like:
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">&gt; ls /scratch/roy/v66/release_dir/
bin/  include/  lib/  man/  sbin/  src/
</pre>
 </div>
 This is very similar to what a HTCondor installation has in it.  Note that if you have a version of HTCondor 7.5.5 or later, do not do the "make release" command.

 <h3>
  Setting up your Personal HTCondor
 </h3>
 <p>
  There are lots of ways to set up a personal HTCondor: I'll show you one way. You want to set up your
  <code>
   PATH
  </code>
  to point at the
  <code>
   bin
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   sbin
  </code>
  directories in your release directory. You want to set
  <code>
   CONDOR_CONFIG
  </code>
  to point at a
  <code>
   condor_config
  </code>
  file. You want to edit your
  <code>
   condor_config
  </code>
  file appropriately. Here is what I do:
  <span class="subsubsection">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h4>
  Make a link to your release directory
 </h4>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">cd /scratch/roy/personal-condor
ln -s /scratch/roy/v66/src/release_dir .
</pre>
 </div>
 With the new
 <a class="external" href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/wiki?p=BuildModernization">
  build
 </a>
 system using cmake, you will want to remove the
 <code>
  src/
 </code>
 part of the path in the above
 <code>
  ln
 </code>
 command, (for versions of HTCondor later than 7.5.5.)
 <p>
  Or, if you want to use the pre-built binaries in the CS pool, the release directory is in "/unsup/condor", and you don't need to make the subdirectories below.
 </p>
 <p>
  Make some directories for HTCondor
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">mkdir execute
mkdir log
mkdir spool
</pre>
 </div>
 <span class="subsubsection">
  <h4>
   Set up your environment
  </h4>
 </span>
 This commands are for tcsh: you'll need to edit them for bash.
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">cat &gt; setup
setenv PATH /scratch/roy/personal-condor/release_dir/bin:${PATH}
setenv PATH /scratch/roy/personal-condor/release_dir/sbin:${PATH}
setenv CONDOR_CONFIG /scratch/roy/personal-condor/condor_config
(control-d)
</pre>
 </div>
 When you do source setup your environment will be set up for your personal HTCondor.
 <span class="subsubsection">
  <h4>
   Create your HTCondor configuration file
  </h4>
 </span>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">cp /scratch/roy/v66/src/condor_examples/condor_config.generic condor_config
touch condor_config.local
</pre>
 </div>
 Now you need to edit your
 <code>
  condor_config
 </code>
 file. Search for the following configuration variables, and set them as follows (using the correct pathnames and email address for you):
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">CONDOR_HOST             = $(FULL_HOSTNAME)
RELEASE_DIR             = /scratch/roy/personal-condor/release_dir
LOCAL_DIR               = /scratch/roy/personal-condor
LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE       = $(LOCAL_DIR)/condor_config.local
CONDOR_ADMIN            = your-email@cs.wisc.edu
UID_DOMAIN              = $(FULL_HOSTNAME)
FILESYSTEM_DOMAIN       = $(FULL_HOSTNAME)

COLLECTOR_HOST  = $(CONDOR_HOST):11000
# Not necessary for late versions of HTCondor
NEGOTIATOR_HOST = $(CONDOR_HOST):11001

# choose a policy for running jobs.
# as of 8.2 the default policy is always_run_jobs
#USE POLICY : ALWAYS_RUN_JOBS
#USE POLICY : DESKTOP

DAEMON_LIST             = MASTER, STARTD, SCHEDD, COLLECTOR, NEGOTIATOR
</pre>
 </div>
 <em>
  Note:
 </em>
 Pick different numbers for the COLLECTOR_HOST and the NEGOTIATOR_HOST. These are port numbers, and each personal HTCondor running on a machine needs to have different ports. Probably randomly picking numbers that are greater than 1024 will be sufficient.
 <p>
  <em>
   Note:
  </em>
  It may be useful to set
  <code>
   CONDOR_HOST = localhost
  </code>
  or
  <code>
   CONDOR_HOST = localhost.localdomain
  </code>
  if the machine running this does not have a valid IP address, is a virtual machine, or the administrator wants HTCondor to look only at that machine.
 </p>
 <p>
  This looks like a lot of things to edit. Why is it so hard? Well, our installation script normally sets things up for you, but because you are using a build environment, it is harder to use the installation script. Also, it is useful for you to be familiar with these settings, so you understand better how HTCondor works.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="subsubsection">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h4>
  Run HTCondor
 </h4>
 <p>
  First, make sure that you will run the correct HTCondor. Which should tell you the one you expect to see:
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">&gt; source setup
&gt; which condor_master
/scratch/roy/personal-condor/release_dir/sbin/condor_master
</pre>
 </div>
 Then run condor_master:
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">condor_master
</pre>
 </div>
 Wait a second, and make sure that everything is running:
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">ps -x | grep condor
</pre>
 </div>
 When you are done with your personal HTCondor, you can kill it with:
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">condor_off -master
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  <span class="subsubsection">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h4>
  Advanced configuration and problem solving
 </h4>
 <p>
  If you are debugging a daemon, you may want to have additional debugging information. For instance, if you are debugging the collector, you can edit COLLECTOR_DEBUG. For instance, you might do:
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">COLLECTOR_DEBUG = D_CAT D_FULLDEBUG D_COMMAND:1
</pre>
 </div>
 Note that this set up described above is rather nice for working with different versions of HTCondor. Just change the link to the release directory, and you can test a different version of HTCondor.
</div>
