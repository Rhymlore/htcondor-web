 <h3>
  limitations and restrictions
 </h3>
 <p>
  The current (2020-05-15) version of this experiment is
  <em>
   extremely
  </em>
  limited.
  <em>
   All
  </em>
  that it does is start instances, which, if they're Debian 10, will join the annex pool.  These instances will have
  <strong>
   AnnexName
  </strong>
  defined in their machine ad, but will otherwise not behave as expected.  In particular, this includes, but is not limited to:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The instance will not terminate itself when HTCondor is turned off (via
   <em>
    condor_off
   </em>
   <em>
    -annex
   </em>
   , usually).
  </li>
  <li>
   The instance will not terminate itself because it is idle.
  </li>
  <li>
   The instance will not terminate itself, nor be terminated, because the annex's duration has expired.
  </li>
  <li>
   The instance will not restrict itself to running jobs from the annexing user,
 or to jobs with
   <strong>
    MayUseAWS
   </strong>
   set.
  </li>
  <li>
   The corresponding command-line options will be ignored.
  </li>
  <li>
   Instances not in the pool will not be tracked.
  </li>
  <li>
   The instance will not prevent user jobs from accessing the instance metadata, which includes things like the pool password and the instance's credentials (if any).
  </li>
 </ul>

 <h3>
  set up
 </h3>
 <p>
  The current (2020-05-15) version of this experiment does not do any GCP set-up for you.  In particular, you must:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   arrange for instances started by
   <em>
    condor_annex
   </em>
   to have a firewall rule allowing inbound port 9618;
  </li>
  <li>
   and provide
   <em>
    condor_annex
   </em>
   with the necessary user credentials.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  The GCP web console's default firewall editing appears to apply to all instances in the project, current and future.
 </p>
 <p>
  To obtain the necessary user credentials, download and install Google's
  <em>
   gcloud
  </em>
  tool (see
  <a class="external" href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gcloud-compute/">
   https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gcloud-compute/
  </a>
  ) and then complete the
  <em>
   gcloud init
  </em>
  process (including logging in).
 </p>
 <p>

 <h3>
  usage

 <p>
  Running
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">condor_annex -gcp -count N</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  will complain about missing command-line options.  You can set defaults for the missing command-line options, and will probably want to, by modifying the user config file, as usual for
  <em>
   condor_annex
  </em>
  .  An example follows:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="snip">
  <pre class="sniplabel">~/.condor/user_config </pre>
  <pre class="snip"># These should be the same for everybody.
ANNEX_DEFAULT_GCP_SERVICE_URL = https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1
ANNEX_DEFAULT_GCP_STARTUP_SCRIPT = $(RELEASE_DIR)/etc/examples/gce-annex-configure.sh

# If you pick a different default zone, adjust the rest of the config appropriately.
ANNEX_DEFAULT_GCP_ZONE = us-central1-a
us_central1_a.ANNEX_DEFAULT_GCP_MACHINE_TYPE = projects/&lt;project ID&gt;/zones/us-central1-a/machineTypes/n1-standard-1
us_central1_a.ANNEX_DEFAULT_GCP_IMAGE_NAME = projects/debian-cloud/global/images/debian-10-buster-v20200413
us_central1_a.ANNEX_DEFAULT_GCP_PROJECT = &lt;project ID&gt;
us_central1_a.ANNEX_DEFAULT_GCP_AUTH_FILE = /home/&lt;username&gt;/.config/gcloud/credentials.db
# Deliberately left blank.  May be useful if you've logged into more than one account with gcloud.
us_central1_a.ANNEX_DEFAULT_GCP_ACCOUNT =
</pre>
