 <p>
  An inspection is simply a short note associated with a
  <span class="wiki">
   <a href="{{ '/wiki-archive/pages/CvstracCheckin' | relative_url }}" title="Cvstrac Checkin">
    check-in
   </a>
  </span>
  . Currently, the limit is 40 characters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inspections may be used to document the results of code reviews and testing.
They may be used to note whether or not the fix worked. They may also be used
to provide directions such as whether or not a check-in should be merged or
backported.
 </p>
 <p>
  Any number of inspections may be associated with a given check-in. If they
check-in is associated with a
  <span class="wiki">
   <a href="{{ '/wiki-archive/pages/CvstracTicket' | relative_url }}" title="Cvstrac Ticket">
    ticket
   </a>
  </span>
  then the
inspections will also be displayed in the ticket view and history pages.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inspections may not be editted or deleted after they're created.
