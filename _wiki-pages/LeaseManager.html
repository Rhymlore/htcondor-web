   Lease Manager Daemon
  </h2>
 </span>
 <p>
  The Lease Manager, as its name implies, is a HTCondor daemon that manages
the leasing of some type of resource within the confines of a HTCondor
pool. What the resource represents is immaterial to the lease manager;
it could be software licenses, disk space, or network I/O.
A lease manager daemon can handle one type of resource. You would
configure and run a seperate lease manager for each type of resource you
want to represent.
 </p>
 <p>
  The architecture of resource leasing is very similar to the matching of
machines with jobs in HTCondor. Offers of and requests for a resource are
represented by classads. The ads are matched with each other, with each
ad able to provide a requirements expression that constrains what it can
be matched against. Resource offers are advertised in the collector by
admin-provided code. The
lease manager periodically queries for these ads. Clients connect to the
lease manager and submit a request ad. The lease manager matches the
request to one or more offers and returns the matching ad(s) to the
client.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are also some differences from the machine/job architecture.
Resource requests and offers include a quantity of resource, represented
by a 32-bit signed integer. An offer's resource can be shared between
multiple requests, and one request can be satisfied by resources from
several offers. The lease manager tracks how much of each offer's
resource has been allocated, and to which requests it's been allocated.
This information is persisted to disk as a classad collection.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each allocation of resources to a request is associated with a unique id
and a lease time. If the requester wishes to use the resources beyond
the lease time, it must renew the lease.
If the requester does not renew the lease before it expires, the
lease manager will reallocate the resources to other requesters.
When the requester is finished
with the resources, it can return them before the lease expires to allow
them to be reallocated sooner.
The lease time is the minimum of the durations set by the offer, the
request, and the lease manager. The lease manager can also impose a
maximum lease time beyond which no renewals are allowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the resources advertised by offer ads drops below the amounts
allocated to requests, the lease manager will refuse to renew some of
the leases so as to respect the new totals.
 </p>
 <p>
  The lease manager responds to three commands: GET_LEASES, RENEW_LEASE,
and RELEASE_LEASE. There is a DCLeaseManager class that clients can use
to interact with the lease manager, which has corresponding methods. The
DCLeaseManager class will return DCLeaseManagerLease objects to the
client which represent the leases. It should be possible for a client to
write the contents of a DCLeaseManagerLease to disk, to be read back
after a failure.
 </p>
 <p>
  The lease manager is used by some portions of stork, but isn't used
anywhere in HTCondor currently. It's included in the HTCondor release.
There are some tests for it in the test suite, one of which is run in
the nmi build/test cycle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Configuration parameters used by the lease manager are documented in the
HTCondor manual.
