title: Why Does My Window Program Not Run

<div id="content">
 First, make sure that the program really does work
outside of HTCondor under Windows,
that the disk is not full,
and that the system is not out of user resources.
 <p>
  As the next consideration,
know that
some Windows programs do not run properly because they are dynamically linked,
and they cannot find the .dll files that they depend on.
HTCondor sets the PATH to be empty whenrunning a job.
To avoid these difficulties, do one of the following
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   statically link the application
  </li>
  <li>
   wrap the job in a script that sets up the environment
  </li>
  <li>
   submit the job from a correctly-set environment with the command
   <div class="code">
    <pre class="code">getenv = true
</pre>
   </div>
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  in the submit description file. This will copy your environment into the job's environment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, send the required .dll files along with the job
using the submit description file command transfer_input_files.
