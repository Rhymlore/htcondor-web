title: Why Large Image Size
layout: wiki-page

<div id="content">
 Sometimes Linux jobs run, are preempted and can not start again because
HTCondor thinks the image size of the job is too big. This is because
HTCondor has a problem calculating the image size of a program on Linux
that uses threads. It is particularly noticeable in the Java universe,
but it also happens in the vanilla universe. It is not an issue in the
standard universe, because threaded programs are not allowed.
 <p>
  On Linux, each thread appears to consume as much memory as the entire
program consumes, so the image size appears to be (number-of-threads *
image-size-of-program). If your program uses a lot of threads, your
apparent image size balloons. You can see the image size that HTCondor
believes your program has by using the -l option to condor_q, and
looking at the
  <span class="wiki">
   <a class="missing" href="{{ '/wiki-archive/pages/ImageSize' | relative_url }}" title="Image Size">
    ImageSize
   </a>
  </span>
  attribute.
 </p>
 <p>
  When you submit your job, HTCondor creates or extends the requirements
for your job. In particular, it adds a requirement that you job must
run on a machine with sufficient memory:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">Requirements = ... ((Memory * 1024) &gt;= ImageSize) ...
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  Note that memory is the execution machine's memory in Mbytes,
while
  <span class="wiki">
   <a class="missing" href="{{ '/wiki-archive/pages/ImageSize' | relative_url }}" title="Image Size">
    ImageSize
   </a>
  </span>
  is in Kbytes.
  <span class="wiki">
   <a class="missing" href="{{ '/wiki-archive/pages/ImageSize' | relative_url }}" title="Image Size">
    ImageSize
   </a>
  </span>
  is not a perfect measure of the memory requirements of a job.
It over-counts memory that is shared between processes.
It may appear quite large if the job uses mmap on a large file.
It does not account for memory that the job uses indirectly in the operating
system's file system cache.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the Requirements expression above,
HTCondor added (Memory * 1024) &gt;=
  <span class="wiki">
   <a class="missing" href="{{ '/wiki-archive/pages/ImageSize' | relative_url }}" title="Image Size">
    ImageSize
   </a>
  </span>
  on behalf of the job.
To prevent HTCondor from doing this,
provide your own expression about memory in the submit description file,
as in this example:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">Requirements = Memory &gt; 1024
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  You will need to change the value 1024 to a reasonably good estimate of
the actual memory requirements of the program, in Mbytes. This example says that
the program requires 1 Gbyte of memory. If you underestimate the
memory your application needs, you may have bad performance if the job
runs on machines that have insufficient memory.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition, if you have modified your machine policies to preempt
jobs when
  <span class="wiki">
   <a class="missing" href="{{ '/wiki-archive/pages/ImageSize' | relative_url }}" title="Image Size">
    ImageSize
   </a>
  </span>
  is large, you will need to change those policies.
 </p>
</div>
