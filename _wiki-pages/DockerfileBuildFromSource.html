<div id="content">
 If Docker is installed on your system, you can use it to easily checkout and build HTCondor from source. Assuming you have sudo access to docker, simply
 <p>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   mkdir some_directory
  </li>
  <li>
   cd some_directory
  </li>
  <li>
   Copy the attached text into a file named "Dockerfile" in this directory.
  </li>
  <li>
   sudo docker build .
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  This may take some time, but will create a docker container with checkout-out and built sources.  You can use the docker commit command to turn the container back into an image.
 </p>
