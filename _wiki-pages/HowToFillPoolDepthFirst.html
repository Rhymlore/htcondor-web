title: How To Fill Pool Depth First
layout: wiki-page
---
<div id="content">
 This HOWTO gives an example configuration to fill jobs depth-first so all the slots on a machine are used before using another machine.
 <p>
  Known to work with HTCondor v8.6.0 or later.
 </p>
 <p>
  Append the following to the condor_config[.local]
  <strong>
   on your pool's central manager
  </strong>
  node:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code"># Change the value of NEGOTIATOR_PRE_JOB_RANK from the default
# value (which is mostly best-fit) to a value that will tend to fill up
# all the slots on a server before moving to another.
# The expression below states the following:
#   1) First sort jobs first according to machine rank.
#   2) Next prefer slots that are unclaimed (idle) over slots
#      that are already running a job.
#   3) Next, prefer to use the highest slot number.  This will
#      fill machines depth first, and is what we are adding here to the default.
#   4) Finally, to break ties, do best fit on CPU and Memory.
NEGOTIATOR_PRE_JOB_RANK = (10000000 * My.Rank) + \
     (1000000 * (RemoteOwner =?= UNDEFINED)) + \
     (100000 * SlotId) + \
     (-10000 * Cpus) - Memory
# If execute nodes are using partitionable slots, SlotId is always
# equal to 1, so this knob
# will state we want to fill fill depth first.  See http://tinyurl.com/y75k3k7p
NEGOTIATOR_DEPTH_FIRST = True
