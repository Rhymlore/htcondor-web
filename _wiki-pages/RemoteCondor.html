   Remote HTCondor (RCondor) Module Description
  </h2>
 </span>
 Remote HTCondor allows a user to submit and monitor batch jobs through a remote instance of HTCondor from his or her computer without having to install HTCondor locally. It does this by providing wrappers of common HTCondor cmdline tools
that will use ssh to execute these commands on the remote machine.
Furthermore, it integrates with sshfs to provide transparent access to data.
 <p>
  It is written entirely in Bash.  RCondor is an ideal solution for laptop users since it is lightweight and highly portable.

 <h2>
  Usage
 </h2>
 Once properly configured, run:
 <div class="verbatim">
  <pre>rcondor_mnt
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  Make sure that any paths corresponding to job executables,
submit files, and job output files are located somewhere
within the LOCAL path specified in rcondor.conf.
Also make sure your current working directory is within the
LOCAL path.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then run a command such as
 </p>
 <div class="verbatim">
  <pre>condor_submit
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  followed by the usual arguments.

 <h2>
  Configuration
 </h2>
 Run:
 <div class="verbatim">
  <pre>rcondor_configure user@host:dir mountpoint
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  These argument fields should correspond to your standard sshfs mount command.
 </p>
 <p>
  It will create a file:
 </p>
 <div class="verbatim">
  <pre>$HOME/.rcondor/rcondor.conf
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  with the lines:
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">USR_HOST = user@host
LOCAL = mountpoint
REMOTE = dir
</pre>
 </div>
