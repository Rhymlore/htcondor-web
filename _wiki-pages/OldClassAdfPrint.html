 already have a compatibility version of this
method, but it doesn't handle chained ads.
 <p>
  It also doesn't print
  <span class="quote">
   MyType
  </span>
  or
  <span class="quote">
   TargetType
  </span>
  if they're not set, nor does it print them first. In old
  <span class="quote">
   ClassAds
  </span>
  , if these are unset, they're printed as empty strings. This shouldn't matter, as the old
  <span class="quote">
   ClassAds
  </span>
  methods that read from a file don't care about the presence or ordering of
  <span class="quote">
   MyType
  </span>
  and
  <span class="quote">
   TargetType
  </span>
  .

  Developer time: 4 hours

 <p>
  Progress: Method now handles chained ads.
