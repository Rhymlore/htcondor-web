  <a class="external" href="https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/downloads/">
   https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/downloads/

  condor-admin@cs.wisc.edu is the primary recipient. The messages are caught by /afs/cs.wisc.edu/p/condor/home/rust/scripts/filter_mail and saved into /p/condor/public/license/native-packages.mbox . Assuming everything is working correctly, you can ignore this.

  As a backup, put your own email address into the .statinfo files. Just archive away the messages as they arrive.
