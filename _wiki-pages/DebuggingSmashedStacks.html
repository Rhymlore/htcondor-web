  Debugging a smashed stack can be difficult because the backtrace is nearly useless. A few tips:

  Pete's core dump technique for finding buffer overruns on the stack:
 </p>
 <p>
  Check the actual addresses in the backtrace. If a few stack frames in a row fail to have the high bit set in any of the bytes of the address, chances are that an ASCII string has walked off the end of the buffer. An example from a real core dump:

 If you think you might have this case, "strings core" can give some clues. After that, open the core file in less. Jump to the end (G), At the very end, or near it you'll find the environment. Jump backward a few pages (Ctrl+B) looking for a large string. That's probably the string responsible for overflowing the buffer on the stack.

  gcc's -fstack-protector
 </h3>
 <p>
  (Section added Aug 1, 2006, adesmet)
 </p>

  Greg Thain offers the following on August 1, 2006:
 </p>
 <p>
  Gcc 4.1 has a new option that can help find these much, much faster. There's a new option, -fstack-protector, which puts a guard word on the stack of each function that has an array on the stack, and checks the guard at function exit. If the guard has changed, it asserts right then and there, before returning. This means that even though the stack is garbage, the innermost frame is still visible and debuggable in gcc. It also means that most buffer overflow attacks won't work.
 </p>
 <p>
  I've fixed a bunch of the HTCondor source code to allow us to compile with this new gcc, but not all of the source code -- in particular, not the externals. Still, all of the daemons can be compiled with this option.
 </p>
 <p>
  We can't just switch to this new gcc because of standard universe and the externals, but I'd recommend to folks that if you suspect a stack buffer overflow, and are sending a debug binary out to a user, that you recompile with this option, it leaves a slime trail of awesomeness in its wake.
