 Sometimes a condor tool or daemon is using a lot of memory, but isn't leaking,
according to valgrind, but just has a lot of memory in use.
 <p>
  Valgrind's massif tool is an easy way to see what lines of code are responsible
for the most memory allocations.  To run massif, simply
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Run the program under question under massif with valgrind --tool=massif my_program my_program_args
  </li>
  <li>
   When the program exits (it will run much more slowly than usual), it will emit a file to the current directory called massif.xxxx where xxxx is the pid of the instrumented program
  </li>
  <li>
   ms_print massif.xxx will print out a textual description of the memory allocations made in the program
  </li>
  <li>
   If your system has KDE support, massif-visualizer may also show this info as a graphical program.
  </li>
