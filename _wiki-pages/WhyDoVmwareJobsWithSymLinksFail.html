title: Why Do Vmware Jobs With Sym Links Fail

<div id="content">
 Why are my vm universe VMware jobs failing and being put on hold?
 <p>
  Strange behavior has been noted when HTCondor tries to run a vm universe VMware job using a path to a VMX that contains a symbolic link. An example of an error message that may appear in such a job's user log:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">Error from starter on master_vmuniverse_strtd@nostos.cs.wisc.edu:
register(/scratch/gquinn/condor/git/CONDOR_SRC/src/condor_tests/31426
/31426vmuniverse/execute/dir_31534/vmN3hylp_condor.vmx) = 1/Error:

</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  This problem may exist when using file transfer,
which is when the submit description file contains
  <code>
   vmware_should_transfer_files = true
  </code>
  .
Work around the problem by modifying configuration variable
  <code>
   EXECUTE
  </code>
  on all execute machines,
such that they do
  <em>
   not
  </em>
  contain symbolic link path components.
 </p>
 <p>
  If using a shared file system, ensure that the submit description file command
  <code>
   vmware_dir
  </code>
  does not use symbolic link path name components.
