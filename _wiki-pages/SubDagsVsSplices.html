<div id="content">
 This document is an explanation of why you might want to use the DAGMan
 <em>
  external sub-DAG
 </em>
 and
 <em>
  splice
 </em>
 features, and which one you might want to use in a particular situation.  (See

 for detailed information about external sub-DAGs and splices,
respectively.)
 <p>
  <strong>
   When should I use one of these features?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Both external sub-DAGs and splices allow you to compose a large workflow from
various sub-pieces that are defined in individual DAG files.  This is the
basic motivation for using either external sub-DAGs or splices:  you want to
create a single workflow from a number of DAG files, either because the
smaller DAG files already exist, or because it's easier to deal with
sub-parts of the workflow.  (One use case might be that you have sub-workflows
that you want to combine in different ways to make different overall
workflows.)
 </p>
 <p>
  Some reasons to use external sub-DAGs or splices:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Create a workflow from separate sub-workflows
  </li>
  <li>
   Dynamically create parts of the workflow (external sub-DAGs only)
  </li>
  <li>
   Re-try multiple nodes as a unit (external sub-DAGs only)
  </li>
  <li>
   Short-circuit parts of the workflow (external sub-DAGs only)
  </li>
 </ul>

  <strong>
   Possible combinatorial explosion of dependencies
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  When one splice is the immediate parent of another splice, it is possible for
an extremely large number of dependencies to be created.  This is because
every "terminal" node of the parent splice becomes a parent of every "inital"
node in the child splice.  So, for example, if the parent splice has 1000
"terminal" nodes and the child splice has 1000 "initial" nodes, 1 million dependencies will be created.  (A "terminal" node is a node that has no
children within its splice; and an "initial" node is a node that has no
parents within its splice.)
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Should I use external sub-DAGs or splices?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The simple answer is that, unless you need one of the features that's
available with external sub-DAGs but not with splices (see the table above), you should use splices.
Splices are generally simpler and have less overhead than external sub-DAGs
(unless the workflow is specifically designed to minimize the external
sub-DAG overhead).
Also, workflow-wide throttling is generally more useful than separate
throttles for sub-parts of the workflow.
