<div id="content">
 CVSTrac normally allows wiki pages to be deleted only by
users with administrator privileges. Users with
 <strong>
  delete
 </strong>
 permissions are also
able to delete some pages within 24 hours of creation. This is normally done to
help prevent
 <a class="external" href="http://cvstrac.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=WikiSpam">
  WikiSpam
 </a>
 .
 <p>
  When a user with delete credentials
looks at a wiki page, one of the buttons on the upper right-hand
corner of the page will be [Delete].  The user just
has to click on this hyperlink to delete the page.
(Actually, a confirmation page appears first, to help prevent
accidental page deletions.)
 </p>
 <p>
  The administrator can also delete historical copies of a page.
To do this, put the page in [History] mode and select the version
of the page to be deleted.  Then click on the [Delete] hyperlink
as before.  The confirmation screen that appears gives the
administrator there options:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Delete the page completely.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Delete the version of the page being viewed and
   all versions.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Delete just the version being viewed.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  CVSTrac stores the complete text of every version of a wiki page
in its database.  If a single page has many edits, it can begin
to take up a lot of space in the database, especially if the page
is big.  Administrators may want to periodically go through and
delete all but the most recent two or three versions of large,
frequently edited pages.
 </p>
 <p>
  All deletions are permanent.
