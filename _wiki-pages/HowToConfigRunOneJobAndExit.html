   How to configure HTCondor on a worker node to run one job and then exit
  </h2>
 </span>
 <p>
  This recipe configures the master and startd on an execute node to exit after the startd runs precisely one job to completion.  This behavior is often desirable in a glide-in situation.

 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">#
# Tell the master to wait a real long time before restarting the startd,
# since when the startd exits we don't want to restart it, we want to go
# away.
#
MASTER_BACKOFF_CONSTANT = 999999

#
# Set CLAIM_WORKLIFE to one second.  This tells the startd to go back
# to Unclaimed/Idle state after any job that runs for more than one
# second completes.
#
CLAIM_WORKLIFE = 1

#
# Modify Start expression so we will not accept a second job after
# the first one completes and the startd goes back to Idle.
#
START = (TotalTimeClaimedBusy =?= UNDEFINED || \\
         TotalTimeClaimedBusy =?= 0 ) \\
         &amp;&amp;  ( $(START) )

#
# Shutdown startd if we are currently idle and have ever been busy
# in the past.
#
STARTD.DAEMON_SHUTDOWN = (Activity=="Idle") &amp;&amp; \
   ((TotalTimeClaimedBusy =!= UNDEFINED) &amp;&amp; (TotalTimeClaimedBusy &gt; 0))

#
# Shutdown the master if the startd exits.  Note that if
# STARTD_StartTime is zero, that the startd is not currently running.
#
MASTER.DAEMON_SHUTDOWN = (STARTD_StartTime =?= 0)
