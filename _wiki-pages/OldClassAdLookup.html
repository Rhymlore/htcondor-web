<div id="content">
 New
 <span class="quote">
  ClassAds
 </span>
 provides Lookup which returns
 <span class="quote">
  ExprTree
 </span>
 *. That looks to be a direct mapping. The
 <span class="quote">
  ExprTree
 </span>
 returned in new
 <span class="quote">
  ClassAds
 </span>
 is just the attribute value and doesn't include the attribute name or assignment operator. The callsites will have to be checked for correct usage.
