 Once per week download an archive of the Design Documents folder on Google Drive and save it to  /afs/cs.wisc.edu/p/condor/gittrac-backups/design-documents.
 <p>
  The exact steps change every once in awhile. As of January 2016:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Go to
   <a class="external" href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BzI9lgnIwjpLaXFwOTRKTTlsanM&amp;usp=sharing">

   </a>
  </li>
  <li>
   (vertical ellipsis) &gt; Download
  </li>
  <li>
   Wait for download to start. Takes anywhere from 10 seconds to 5 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
   Ensure the filename has the form "HTCondor_Design_Documents-YYYY-MM-DD.zip. Current Google Drive does this automatically.
  </li>
  <li>
   Save the file into /afs/cs.wisc.edu/p/condor/gittrac-backups/design-documents .
  </li>
  <li>
   Check that the file size is roughly 1 MB.
  </li>
  <li>
   Everyone once in a while open it up and check a few random files to ensure everything looks okay.
  </li>
 </ol>
