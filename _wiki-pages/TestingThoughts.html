 Changes to release process
 <ul>
  <li>
   How long do we need to run on CSL/NMI/CHTC?
  </li>
  <li>
   How much notice can we give to CSL/NMI/CHTC?
  </li>
  <li>
   We need release notes ahead of beta testers upgrade
  </li>
  <li>
   Can we change the HTCondor release version to include the run id?
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Test pool?
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Should we run a test pool that we upgrade before the pre-release to NMI/CHTC?
   <ul>
    <li>
     Should NMI have a shadow pool that functions as the test pool?
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   Maybe NMI should not be running the development series?
  </li>
  <li>
   Can we submit VMs to CHTC?  The VMs can have any version of HTCondor installed
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Testing of tarballs:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Still working on integrating the tarball tests in
  </li>
  <li>
   RPM/Deb tests up next
  </li>
  <li>
   Should we do extra manual tests before release checking for things that are hard to automate?  Examples:
   <ul>
    <li>
     Difference in tarball size between this and last version
    </li>
    <li>
     Difference in number of files between this and last version
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Testing cross version
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Should we run a test that validates compatibility between HTCondor releases, esp. point release?
   <ul>
    <li>
     Could we do this in NMI using "parallel" ability?
    </li>
    <li>
     If not automated in NMI what about just doing a manual test before release?
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Platform list
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Meet with NMI and HTCondor to get platforms to drop
  </li>
  <li>
   Likely candidates include AIX, HPUX
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Improvements to build status page:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Change tasks to be sorted by the order they run (rather than alpha order)
  </li>
  <li>
   Change colors so that tests which have not yet run are not green (make them gray?)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Improvements to builds:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Stop running NMI ports tests on anything except appropriate branch (it currently does not need to run on master or V7_4)
  </li>
 </ul>
