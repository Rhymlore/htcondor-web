 <strong class="three">
  CVSTrac Ticket State
 </strong>
 <p>
  The default ticket states are (at the database level)
  <em>
   new
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   review
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   defer
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   active
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   fixed
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   tested
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   closed
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  While it is certainly possible to change them, note that internally CVSTrac
interprets states starting with the characters "n" or "a" as
  <strong>
   active
  </strong>
  and those
starting with "f", "t" or "c" as
  <strong>
   fixed
  </strong>
  .
