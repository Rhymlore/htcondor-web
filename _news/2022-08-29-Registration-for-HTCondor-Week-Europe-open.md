We are pleased to announce the European HTCondor Workshop 2022. The workshop will take place as an 'in-person event' from Tuesday 11 October 09:00 h
to Friday 14 October at lunchtime.

The site for registration and detailed information is now online:
[https://indico.cern.ch/event/1174979/](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1174979/)

The workshop will be hosted by the INFN, Sezione di Torino and held in the beautiful town of Cuneo (near Torino).

The workshop will be an excellent occasion for learning from the sources (the developers!) about HTCondor, exchanging with your colleagues about experiences and plans, and providing your feedback to the experts. The HTCondor Compute Element (CE) will be covered in detail as well. Participation is open to all organisations (including companies) and persons interested in HTCondor (and by no means restricted to particle physics and/or academia!) If you know potentially interested persons, don't hesitate to make them aware of this opportunity.

If you consider attending, we would very much like to know about your project, your experience and your plans. Hence you are warmly encouraged to propose a short presentation. Details on how to submit abstracts will follow.

If you have any questions, please contact

We are looking forward to a rich, productive workshop, and we hope to meet many of you at our first in-person workshop in three years!
