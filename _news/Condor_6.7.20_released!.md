The Condor Team is pleased to announce the release of Condor 6.7.20.  This release features many bugfixes and new features, including a variety of built-in functions that can be used in ClassAds and a unified mapfile providing more flexible identity management when using strong authentication.  See the <a href="manual/latest-dev/9_Version_History.html"> Version History and Release Notes</a> for further details. Condor 6.7.20 is available from our <a href="downloads//">Downloads</a> page.  We believe 6.7.20 is fairly stable, but it is not recommended for production systems, unless you require checkpointing support for a Linux distribution not supported by our 6.6 releases.
