The European HTCondor Workshop 2021 will be held Monday Sept 20 through
Friday Sept 24 as a purely online event via videoconference. The workshop is
an opportunity for novice and experienced users of HTCondor to learn, get help
and have exchanges between them and with the HTCondor developers and experts.
This event is organized by the European community (and optimized for European
timezones) but everyone worldwide is welcomed to attend and participate.

conference page linked above via the "Call for Abstracts" link.
