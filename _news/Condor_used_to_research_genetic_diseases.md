"[Sleeping Computers Unravel Genetic Diseases] (Archived Url: 'http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/520969/')."  "Now, with the help of the Condor middleware system, Superlink-Online is running in parallel on 200 computers at the Technion and 3,000 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison."  "'Over the last half year, dozens of geneticists around the world have used Superlink-Online, and thousands of runs – totaling 70 computer years – have been recorded,' says Professor Assaf Schuster, head of the Technion’s Distributed Systems Laboratory, which developed Superlink-Online’s computational infrastructure.
