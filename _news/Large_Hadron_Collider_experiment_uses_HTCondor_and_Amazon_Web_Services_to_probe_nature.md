This <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/experiment-that-discovered-the-higgs-boson-uses-aws-to-probe-nature/">Amazon Web services blog post</a> explains how scientists at Fermilab (a Tier 1 data center for the CMS experiment at the LHC) use HTCondor and Amazon Web Services to elastically adapt their computational capacity to changing requirements. Fermilab added 58,000 cores with HTCondor and AWS, allowing them to simulate 500 million events in 10 days using 2.9 million jobs. Adding cores dynamically improves cost efficiency by provisioning resources only when they are needed.
