IBM developerWorks has published a very nice tutorial on using Condor's web services interface (Birdbath).  Jeff Mausolf, IBM Application Architect, states "This tutorial is intended to introduce the Web services interface of Condor. We'll develop a Java technology-based Web services client and demonstrate the major functions of Condor exposed to clients through Web services. The Web services client will submit, monitor, and control jobs in a Condor environment."
