<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/04/06/cycle_computing_hpc_cloud/">Cycle Computing used Condor to create a 10,000-core cluster on top of Amazon EC2.</a>  The virtual cluster was used for 8 hours to provide 80,000 hours of compute time for protein analysis work for Genentech.  "The 10,000-core cluster that Cycle Computing set up and ran for eight hours on behalf of Genentech would have ranked at 114 on the Top 500 computing list from last November (the most current ranking), so it was not exactly a toy even if the cluster was ephemeral."
