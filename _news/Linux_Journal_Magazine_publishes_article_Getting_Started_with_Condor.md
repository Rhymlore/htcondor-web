Author Irfan Habib wrote in Linux Journal magazine his experience getting started with Condor.  He concludes, "Condor provides the unique possibility of using our current computing infrastructure and investments to target processing of jobs that are simply beyond the capabilities of our most powerful systems... Condor is not only a research toy, but also a piece of robust open-source software that solves real-world problems."
