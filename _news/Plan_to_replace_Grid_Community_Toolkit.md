We are working to retire the use of the Grid Community Toolkit libraries (or GCT, which is a fork of the former Globus Toolkit) in the HTCondor Software Suite. Functionality provided by the GCT, such as GSI authentication, is rapidly being replaced by the use of IDTOKENS, SciTokens, and plain SSL within the ecosystem. Especially if your organization relies on GSI, please <a href="https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/wiki?p=PlanToReplaceGridCommunityToolkit"> see this article on the htcondor-wiki</a> that details our timeline and milestones for replacing GCT in HTCondor and the HTCondor-CE.
