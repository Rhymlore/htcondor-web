The Condor Team is pleased to announce the release of Condor 7.2.1. This release addresses a handful of critical Windows-specific problems that were discovered after the release of Condor 7.2.0. This release also adds a native clipped port to Debian 5.0 (Lenny), support for the gfortran compiler in standard universe, support for standard output and error files larger than 2GB, and several other bug fixes. See the <a href="manual/latest-stable/9_Version_History.html">version history</a> for a detailed list of changes.
