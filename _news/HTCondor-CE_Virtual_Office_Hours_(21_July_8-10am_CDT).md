On July 21, the CHTC will be hosting virtual office hours for the HTCondor-CE from 8-10am CDT. The HTCondor-CE software is a Compute Entrypoint (CE) based on HTCondor for sites that are part of a larger computing grid (http://htcondor-ce.org).  During these office hours, we will be hosting a virtual room for general discussion with additional breakout rooms where you can meet with CHTC team members to discuss specific topics and questions. No appointment needed, just drop in!  Office hour coordinates will be made available on the day of the event on this page: <a href="https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/office-hours/2020-07-21-HTCondorCE">https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/office-hours/2020-07-21-HTCondorCE</a>
