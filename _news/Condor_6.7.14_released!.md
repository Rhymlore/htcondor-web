The Condor Team is pleased to announce the release of Condor 6.7.14.  Highlights include grid universe support for NorduGrid and Unicore, system job policy expressions, and job start time deferral. Users of prior version of 6.7.x are encouraged to upgrade.  See the <a href="manual/latest-dev/9_Version_History.html"> Version History and Release Notes</a> for details. Condor 6.7.14 is available from our <a href="downloads/">Downloads</a> page.  We believe 6.7.14 is fairly stable, but it is not recommended for production systems, unless you require checkpointing support for a Linux distribution not supported by our 6.6 releases.
