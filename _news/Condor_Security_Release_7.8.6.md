The Condor Team is pleased to announce the release of Condor 7.8.6. which contains an important security fix that was incorrectly documented as being in the 7.8.5 release.  This release is otherwise identical to the 7.8.5 release.  Affected users should upgrade as soon as possible.  More details on the security issue can be found [here] (Archived Url: 'security/vulnerabilities/CONDOR-2012-0003.html').  Condor binaries and source code are available from our [Downloads page] (Archived Url: 'downloads/').
