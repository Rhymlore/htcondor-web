The HTCondor Team is pleased to announce the release of HTCondor version 8.1.3. This development release contains all the bug fixes from the stable release version 8.0.5. Major new features include: the parsing of configuration has changed such that comments are permitted within multi-line definitions; the condor_sos tool helps administrators manage overloaded daemons by causing commands to be handled with a higher priority; a new Python binding reads event logs. A complete list of bugs fixed and features can be found in the  <a href="manual/v8.1.3/10_3Development_Release.html">Version History</a>.
