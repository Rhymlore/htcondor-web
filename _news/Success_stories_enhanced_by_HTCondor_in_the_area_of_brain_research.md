International Science Grid This Week (ISGTW) reports on two research efforts in the area of brain research. The work of Ned Kalin is highlighted in this article on [brain circuitry and mechanisms underlying anxiety] (Archived Url: 'http://www.isgtw.org/feature/brain-circuitry-and-mechanisms-underlying-anxiety-uncovered'). And, high throughput computing permits the research of Mike Koenigs in [psychopathy] (Archived Url: 'http://www.isgtw.org/feature/psychopathy-research-ripe-discovery-high-throughput-computing') to analyze data in days, when without HTC, it might take years.
