International Science Grid This Week (ISGTW) reports on two research efforts in the area of brain research. The work of Ned Kalin is highlighted in this article on <a href="http://www.isgtw.org/feature/brain-circuitry-and-mechanisms-underlying-anxiety-uncovered" data-proofer-ignore>brain circuitry and mechanisms underlying anxiety</a>. And, high throughput computing permits the research of Mike Koenigs in <a href="http://www.isgtw.org/feature/psychopathy-research-ripe-discovery-high-throughput-computing" data-proofer-ignore>psychopathy</a> to analyze data in days, when without HTC, it might take years.
