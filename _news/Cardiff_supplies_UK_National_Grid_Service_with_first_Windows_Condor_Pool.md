Cardiff University announces the availability of a 1,000 processor Condor Pool to the UK National Grid Service.  "Use by the University's researchers has grown considerably in this time and has saved local researchers years of time in processing their results." "Using Gasbor to build a model of a typical Tropoelastin molecule takes 30 hours. Using Condor the same simulation ran in just two hours."
