The HTCondor team has released updated RPMs for HTCondor versions 8.4.12, 8.6.5, and 8.7.2 running on Enterprise Linux 7. In the recent Red Hat 7.4 release, the updated SELinux targeted policy package prevented HTCondor's SELinux policy module from loading. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 systems running with SELinux enabled will require this update for HTCondor to function properly.
