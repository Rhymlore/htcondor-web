Condor version 6.1.11 contains a large number of bug fixes, and new features.   In particular, there is enhanced support for various remote system calls, a much better infrastructure for Condor-level I/O buffering, and better reporting in the notification email. In addition, limited support for network sockets within "standard universe" jobs is now available. This is also the first version with full support for checkpointing and remote system calls under Irix 6.5.
