The Condor Team is pleased to announce the release of Condor 6.7.9.  This version is primarily for the new parallel universe, but also includes many bug fixes and improvements to Condor-C.  See the <a href="manual/latest-dev/9_Version_History.html"> Version History and Release Notes</a> for details. Condor 6.7.9 is available from our <a href="downloads/">Downloads</a> page.  We believe 6.7.9 is fairly stable, but it is not recommended for production systems, unless you require checkpointing support for a Linux distribution not supported by our 6.6 releases.
