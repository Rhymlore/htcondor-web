This <a href="https://aciref.org/when-a-lot-of-little-things-add-up-to-a-lot-of-time-htcondor-to-the-rescue/" data-proofer-ignore>article</a> explains how the Clemson Center for Geospatial Technologies (CCGT) was able to use HTCondor to help a student analyze large amounts of GIS (Geographic Information System) data. The article contains a good explanation of how the data was divided up in such a way as to allow it to be processed using an HTCondor pool.  Using HTCondor allowed the data to be analyzed in approximately 3 hours, as opposed to the 4.11 days it would have taken on a single computer.
