We are very pleased to announce that the 2022 European HTCondor Workshop
will be held from **Tuesday 11th October to Friday 14th October**. Save the dates!

Due to the current easing of restrictions on gathering and travel we are planning
to return to an in-person format meeting. So, we are delighted to announce that INFN-Torino
have offered to host the meeting in the beautiful Italian city of Cuneo near Torino.

To allow ease of travel to and from the venue the meeting will start at on Tuesday morning
and run until lunchtime on the Friday.

The workshop will be an excellent occasion for learning from the sources (the developers!)
about HTCondor, exchanging with your colleagues about experiences and plans and providing
your feedback to the experts. The HTCondor Compute Entrypoint (CE) will be covered as well.
Participation is open to all organisations (including companies) and persons interested in
HTCondor (and by no means restricted to particle physics and/or academia!) If you know
potentially interested persons, don't hesitate to make them aware of this opportunity.

The workshop will cover both using and administering HTCondor; topics will be chosen to
best match participants' interests. We would very much like to know about your use of
HTCondor, in you project, your experience and your plans. Hence you are warmly encouraged
to propose a short presentation.

Registration and abstract submission will be opened in due course; a dedicated message will be sent once available,
as well as a link to the workshop posted on the website.

If you have any questions, please contact <hepix-2022condorworkshop-support@hepix.org>

We are looking forward to a rich, productive workshop, and we hope to meet many of you 
at our first in-person workshop for three years!
