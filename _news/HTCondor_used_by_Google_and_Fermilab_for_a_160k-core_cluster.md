At SC16, the HTCondor Team, Google, and Fermilab demonstrated a 160k-core cloud-based elastic compute cluster.  This cluster uses resources from the Google Cloud Platform provisioned and managed by HTCondor as part of Fermilab's HEPCloud facility. The following  [article] (Archived Url: 'https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/11/Google-Cloud-HEPCloud-and-probing-the-nature-of-Nature.html') gives more information on this compute cluster, and discusses how the bursty nature of computational demands is making the use of cloud resources increasingly important for scientific computing. Find out more information about the Google Cloud Platform [here] (Archived Url: 'https://cloud.google.com/').
