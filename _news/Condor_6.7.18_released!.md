The Condor Team is pleased to announce the release of Condor 6.7.18.  This release features important security fixes and many other improvements.  See the <a href="manual/latest-dev/9_Version_History.html"> Version History and Release Notes</a> for further details. Condor 6.7.18 is available from our <a href="downloads/">Downloads</a> page.  We strongly recommend sites running earlier versions of Condor in the 6.7 development series upgrade to 6.7.18 as soon as feasible.  We believe 6.7.18 is fairly stable, but it is not recommended for production systems, unless you require checkpointing support for a Linux distribution not supported by our 6.6 releases.
