The CondorView Client contrib module automatically generates HTML pages that publish usage statistics about your pool to the World Wide Web. Quickly and easily view how much Condor is being used, how many cycles are being delivered, and who is using them. View utilization by machine platform or by user. Interact with a Java applet to customize the visualization, or to zoom-in to a specific time frame.
