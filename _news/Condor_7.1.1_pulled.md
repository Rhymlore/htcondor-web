The Condor Team has pulled Condor 7.1.1 from the web due to several problems with it (a bad memory leak in the startd, and authentication problems under Windows).  We plan to release 7.1.2 within a week to address these problems.  In the mean time, you can download 7.1.0 from <a href="downloads/">our Downloads page.</a>
