Thank you to all in-person and virtual participants in Throughput Computing 2023. Over the course of the event we had 79 talks spanning tutorials, applications and science domains using HTCSS and OSG Services. In addition to the talks, and in spite of the rain, we enjoyed many opportunities to socialize and continue to strengthen the HTC community. 

All slides can be found on the [event archives](/past_condor_weeks.html) and we will be publishing all videos on our youtube channel under "Throughput Computing 2023".

We hope to see you next year!
