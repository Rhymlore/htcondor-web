The usage license for Condor has changed to the <a href="condor-public-license.html">Condor Public License</a>, a very liberal license that permits installation, use, reproduction, display, modification and redistribution of Condor, with or without modification, in source and binary forms. This license has already been applied to the binary downloads for Condor version 6.4.7 for both UNIX and Windows.  The Condor Team is busily preparing the source code for public release under the terms of the Condor Public License as well.  Stay tuned!
