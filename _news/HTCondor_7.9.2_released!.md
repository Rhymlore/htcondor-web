The HTCondor team is pleased to announce the release of HTCondor 7.9.2. Now with more HT.  This release contains all of the bug fixes added to the 7.8.6 stable release, and most of those added to the  upcoming 7.8.7 stable release. This release also contains improvements in DAGMan, use of cgroups, and changes to improve the privacy of user data.  This release has known problems with glexec that we expect to have fixed in the next developer release.  Users of glexec should skip this release.  A complete list of bugs and features can be found in the  <a href="manual/v7.9/9_3Development_Release.html">Version History</a>.  HTCondor 7.9.2 binaries and source code are available from our <a href="downloads/">Downloads page</a>.
