 IBM IT Architect Jeff Mausolf writes, "In this article, we will look at how you can use Condor to simplify the tasks associated with job submission, monitoring, and control in a Globus environment. In Part 2, we will look at how you can use Condor's matchmaking to make intelligent scheduling decisions based on job requirements and resource information, and then leverage the remote resource access capabilities provided by Globus to submit jobs to resources that are not part of the Condor pool."
