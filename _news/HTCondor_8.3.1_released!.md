The HTCondor Team is pleased to announce the release of HTCondor version 8.3.1. This release contains a variety of changes that reduce memory usage and improve performance. If cgroups are used to limit memory utilization, HTCondor sets both the memory and swap limits. A complete list of bugs fixed and features can be found in the <a href="manual/v8.3.1/10_3Development_Release.html">Version History</a>. HTCondor 8.3.1 binaries and source code are available from our <a href="downloads/">Downloads</a> page.
