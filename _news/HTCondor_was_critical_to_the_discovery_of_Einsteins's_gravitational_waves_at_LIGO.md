This  [New Universe Daily news article] (Archived Url: 'http://newuniversedaily.com/2016/03/08/the-cyber-brain-behind-ligos-gravitational-waves-discovery/') discusses the collaboration between the HTCondor team at UW-Madison and the LIGO team at UW-Milwaukee, and how the HTCondor software was critical to the discovery of gravitational waves and will continue to be vital as LIGO moves forward.  "For 20 years, LIGO was trying to find a needle in a haystack. Now we’re going to build a needle detection factory,” said Peter Couvares, a Senior Scientist with the LIGO project.
