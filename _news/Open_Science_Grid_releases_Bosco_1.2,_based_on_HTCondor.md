Bosco is a client for Linux and Mac operating systems for submitting jobs to  remote batch systems without administrator assistance. It is designed for end-users, and only requires ssh access to one or more cluster front-ends. Target clusters can be HTCondor, LSF, PBS, SGE or SLURM managed resources.   The [new Bosco 1.2 release] (Archived Url: 'http://bosco.opensciencegrid.org/2013/06/bosco-1-2-release/') is much easier to install, will handle more jobs,  will send clearer error messages, and makes it easier to specify the memory you need inside the clusters you connect to.
