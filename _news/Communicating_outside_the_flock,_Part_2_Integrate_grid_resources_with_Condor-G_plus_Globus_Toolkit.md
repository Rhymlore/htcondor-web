IBM IT Architect Jeff Mausolf writes, "The Globus Toolkit provides a grid security infrastructure. By augmenting this infrastructure with the job submission, management, and control features of Condor, we can create a grid that extends beyond the Condor pool to include resources controlled by a number of resource managers, such as LoadLeveler, Platform LSF or PBS."
