The article <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cost-effective-exaflop-hour-clouds-icecube-igor-sfiligoi/">"A cost effective ExaFLOP hour in the Clouds for IceCube"</a> discusses how an existing HTCondor pool was augmented with resources dynamically acquired  from AWS, Azure, Google, Open Science Grid, and on-prem resources to perform science for the <a href="https://icecube.wisc.edu/">IceCube</a> project.  The objective, on top of (obviously) the science output, was to demonstrate how much compute can someone integrate during a regular working day, using only the two most cost effective SKUs for each Cloud provider.
