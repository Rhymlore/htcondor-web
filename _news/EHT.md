On the morning of May 12, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Project announced that it had produced an image of a supermassive black hole at the center 
of the Milky Way, only the second image of its kind in history. EHT, a collaboration of more than 300 astronomers, 80 institutions, and eight telescopes 
across the globe, harnesses the power of the OSG Consortium's Open Science Pool (OSPool) to process their vast amounts of both experimental and simulated 
data. As a bedrock technology behind the OSPool, the HTCondor Software Suite helped unlock this mystery in our very own galaxy.
