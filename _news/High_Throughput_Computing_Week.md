High Throughput Computing Week in Edinburgh is a four-day event in November 2007 that will discuss several aspects of high throughput computing (HTC), including transforming a task so it can benefit from HTC and choosing technologies to deliver HTC, as well as trying some HTC systems in-person. Condor will be one of the four technologies discussed. <a href="http://www.nesc.ac.uk/esi/events/831/" data-proofer-ignore>More Details</a>
