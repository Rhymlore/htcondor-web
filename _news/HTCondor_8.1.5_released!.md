The HTCondor Team is pleased to announce the release of HTCondor version 8.1.5. Major new features include: a change to the default policy, such that it does not preempt jobs; several new instances of non-blocking I/O to improve performance; fewer server resources are used by the condor_schedd when handling condor_q requests; a bug fix, such that large submit description files do not cause condor_submit to crash; a bug fix, such that large configuration files do not cause the condor_master daemon to crash. A complete list of bugs fixed and features can be found in the <a href="manual/v8.1.5/10_3Development_Release.html">Version History</a>. HTCondor 8.1.5 binaries and source code are available from our <a href="downloads/">Downloads</a> page.
