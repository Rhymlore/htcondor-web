The HTCondor team is pleased to announce the release of HTCondor 8.3.2. This development series release contains new features that are under development. This release contains all of the bug fixes from the 8.2.6 stable release. This new version contains: the next installment of IPv4/IPv6 mixed mode support: a submit node can simultaneously interact with an IPv4 and an IPv6 HTCondor pool; scalability improvements: a reduced memory foot-print of daemons, a reduced number of TCP connections between submit and execute machines, and an improved responsiveness from a busy condor_schedd to queries. A complete list of new features and fixed bugs can be found in the <a href="manual/v8.3.2/10_3Development_Release.html">Version History</a>. HTCondor 8.3.2 binaries and source code are available from our <a href="downloads/">Downloads</a> page.
