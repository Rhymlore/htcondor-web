At long last, the development series of Condor has been released.   It supports Solaris 2.5.1 and 2.6 on Intel and Sparc platforms, Linux for Intel (libc5 and glibc), SGI IRIX 6.2 through 6.4, Digital Unix 4.0, and HPUX 10.20.  You can read about <a href="manual/latest-dev/9_Version_History.html">what's new</a> in this version.   It contains various new features, including support for SMP machines, "flocking", the new CondorView server, and other things.  Most of these features can also be installed in your stable pool by using the "contrib" modules that are also released (see above).
