Regrettably, due to an error in building 7.6.8, it is not a valid release and has been pulled from the web.  Please update to version 7.6.9 or 7.8.2 instead to address the security issue posted yesterday.  More details on the security problem can be found [here] (Archived Url: 'security/vulnerabilities/CONDOR-2012-0002.html'), and Condor binaries and source code are available from our [Downloads page] (Archived Url: 'downloads/').
