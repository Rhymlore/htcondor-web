This  <a href="http://www.opensciencegrid.org/atlas-and-bnl-bring-amazon-ec2-online/">Open Science Grid news article</a> discusses how a pilot project at the RHIC/ATLAS Computing Facility (RACF) at Brookhaven National Laboratory has used HTCondor-G to incorporate virtual machines from Amazon's Amazonâ€™s Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) spot market into a scientific computation platform. The ATLAS experiment is moving towards using commercial clouds for computation as budget constraints make maintaining dedicated data centers more difficult.
