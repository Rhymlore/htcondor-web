6.7.3 is the fourth release of our development series. 6.7.3 is primarily a new feature release. 6.7.3 is the first release to fully support  checkpointing on Linux distributions Fedora Core 1, 2, and 3.   6.7.3 also includes preliminary support for a new remote submission feature that will complement flocking and the grid universe. See the  <a href="manual/latest-dev/9_Version_History.html">Version History and Release Notes</a> for details. Condor 6.7.3 is available from our  <a href="downloads/">Downloads</a> page. We believe 6.7.3 is fairly stable, but it is not recommended  for production systems, unless you require checkpointing support for a  Linux distribution not supported by our 6.6 releases. Users of previous  6.7 versions are urged to upgrade.
