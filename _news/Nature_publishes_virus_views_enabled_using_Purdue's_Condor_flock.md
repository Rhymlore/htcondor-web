As published in the Feb 28th issue of Nature, a team led by a Purdue University researcher has achieved images of a virus in detail two times greater than had previously been achieved. [This breakthrough was enabled through the use of Purdue's Condor distributed computing grid] (Archived Url: 'http://news.uns.purdue.edu/x/2008a/080311JiangCondor.html'), which comprises more than 7,000 computers.
