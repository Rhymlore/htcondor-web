The National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Science announced today that they have joined forces to fund a five-year,  million program to operate and expand upon the two-year-old national grid. This project collectively taps into the power of thousands of processors distributed across more than 30 participating universities and federal research laboratories.  UW-Madison computer scientist Miron Livny, leader of the Condor Project, is principal investigator of OSG and will be in charge of building, maintaining, and coordinating software activities.
