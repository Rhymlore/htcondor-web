The National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Science announced today that they have joined forces to fund a five-year,  million program to operate and expand upon the two-year-old national grid. This project collectively taps into the power of thousands of processors distributed across more than 30 participating universities and federal research laboratories.  UW-Madison computer scientist Miron Livny, leader of the Condor Project, is principal investigator of OSG and will be in charge of building, maintaining, and coordinating software activities. <a href="http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000128">[OSG Press Release]</a><a href="http://www.ddj.com/blog/portal/archives/2006/09/grids_opening_t.html">[DDJ Article]</a><a href="http://badgerherald.com/news/2006/09/26/computer_grid_projec.php">[Badger Herald Article]</a>
