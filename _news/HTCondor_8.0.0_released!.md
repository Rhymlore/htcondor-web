The HTCondor team is pleased to announce the release of HTCondor 8.0.0. This release is the first in the new stable series. The major version number changed because of the project rename to HTCondor and not because of major incompatibility with the version 7.8 stable series. This new version contains Bosco, support for EC2 Spot instances, interactive jobs, improved job sandboxing, native python API and several new tools. A complete list of bugs fixed and features can be found in the  <a href="manual/v8.0/10_3Stable_Release.html">Version History</a>. HTCondor 8.0.0 binaries and source code are available from our <a href="downloads/">Downloads</a> page.
