GRIDtoday reports in the article "<a href="http://www.gridtoday.com/grid/1200956.html" data-proofer-ignore>Protein Wranglers</a>" that NCSA researchers are using Condor-G to streamline their workflow.  "They were spending quite a bit of time doing relatively trivial management tasks, such as moving data back and forth, or resubmitting failed jobs,' says Kufrin. After gaining familiarity with the existing 'human-managed' tasks that are required to carry out lengthy, computationally intensive simulations of this nature, the team identified Condor-G, an existing, proven Grid-enabled implementation of Condor, as a possible solution."
