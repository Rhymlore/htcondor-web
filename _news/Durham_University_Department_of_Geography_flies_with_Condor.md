In 2006 the Durham University Department of Geography began examining ways of increasing the speed at which research results could be obtained from geophysical modelling simulations.  After a period of testing lasting over 6 months, the Department of Geography has successfully implemented a distributed computing system built upon the Condor platform.  Since its implementation, the Condor distributed computing network has provided a unique facility for spatial modelling which is particularly suited to Monte Carlo approaches. Thanks to the processing power offered by the Condor network, members of the Catchment, River and Hillslope Science (CRHS) group have developed methods of ultra-high resolution image processing and remote sensing which are pushing the traditional boundaries of ecological monitoring at both catchment and local scales.
