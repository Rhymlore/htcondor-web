Researchers and software engineers at the Intel-Broad Center for Genomic Data Engineering build, optimize, and widely share new tools and infrastructure that will help scientists integrate and process genomic data. The project is optimizing best practices in hardware and software for genome analytics to make it possible to combine and use research data sets that reside on private, public, and hybrid clouds, and have recently identified HTCondor on their web site as an open source framework well suited for genomics analytics.
