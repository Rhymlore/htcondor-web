The HTCondor team, together with Worldwide LHC Computing Grid Deployment Board, is offering a four-day workshop the 8th through the 11th of December at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, for HTCondor pool administrators.  Topics envisioned include pool configuration, management, theory of operation, sharing of best practices and experiences, and monitoring of individual HTCondor batch pools. Special subjects of emphasis may include: scheduling, pool policy selection, performance tuning, debugging failures, and previews of upcoming features of HTCondor. Time will be provided for question and answer sessions. Attendees should have some knowledge of Linux and network administration, but no HTCondor experience will be required. See <a href="http://indico.cern.ch/event/272794/">the workshop's web site</a> to register and for more details.
