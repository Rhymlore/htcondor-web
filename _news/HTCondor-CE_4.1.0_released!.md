The HTCondor team is pleased to announce the release of HTCondor-CE 4.1.0.  HTCondor-CE is a grid gateway that forwards resource provisioning requests to your local cluster. HTCondor-CE was originally developed by the Open Science Grid (OSG). The Center for High-Throughput Computing (CHTC) now distributes and supports HTCondor-CE for use outside of the OSG.  Highlights of this release are: Added the ability to configure the environment of routed jobs; Simplified APEL configuration; Fixed the ability to specify certificate locations for SSL authentication; Refined the APEL record filter to ignore jobs that have not yet started; Fixed an issue where "condor_ce_q" required authentication; Re-enabled the ability for local users to submit jobs to the CE queue; Fixed an issue where some jobs were capped at 72 mins instead of 72 hrs; Improved BDII provider error handling.  A complete list of new features and fixed bugs can be found in the <a href="https://htcondor-ce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releases/#htcondor-ce-4-version-history"> version history</a>. HTCondor-CE 4.1.0 binaries are available from our <a href="http://htcondor.org/yum/">YUM Repository</a>.
