Version 0.1.0 of the Condor "Setup Hawkeye" package is now available. We've been getting an increasing stream of requests to make it easier to  add Hawkeye features to your existing Condor. To solve this problem, we've created the above package which modifies  your Condor configuration &amp; installs the same "install module" script as is  used in Hawkeye (except that here it's named condor_install_module instead of  hawkeye_install_module).  You can then download &amp; install the same modules as  you can for Hawkeye, and can then use the dynamic attributes in your Machine  Ad for match-making purposes.  More details are available through the <a HREF="hawkeye">Hawkeye page</a>
