The default Linux kernel shipped with Red Hat 6.2 contains a bug which Condor can trigger.  This would cause Red Hat 6.2 machines running Condor to hang.  All Red Hat 6.2 users should either upgrade their kernel to 2.2.16 or later, or upgrade to Condor Version 6.1.15, which will be out early the week of 8/21/00.
