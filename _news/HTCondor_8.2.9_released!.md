The HTCondor team is pleased to announce the release of HTCondor version 8.2.9. A stable series release contains significant bug and security fixes. This version contains: a mechanism for the preemption of dynamic slots, such that the partitionable slot may use the dynamic slot in the match of a different job; default configuration bug fixes for the desktop policy, such that it can both start jobs and monitor the keyboard.  A complete list of fixed bugs can be found in the <a href="manual/v8.2.9/10_3Stable_Release.html">Version History</a>. HTCondor 8.2.9 binaries and source code are available from our <a href="downloads/">Downloads</a> page.
