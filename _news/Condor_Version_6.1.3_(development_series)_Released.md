The latest version of the development series is now available for <a href="downloads/">download</a>.   <font color="#ff0000">NOTE: There are a lot of new, unstable features in 6.1.3. PLEASE do not install all of 6.1.3 on a production pool. Almost all of the bug fixes in 6.1.3 are in the condor_startd or condor_starter, so, unless you really know what you're doing, we recommend you just upgrade SMP-Startd contrib module, not the entire 6.1.3 release.</font> In addition, many things dealing with queue management have been overhauled, so tools such as condor_q, condor_rm, and others, are incompatible with older versions.  For complete details, you can read about <a href="manual/latest-dev/9_Version_History.html">what's new</a> in this version.
