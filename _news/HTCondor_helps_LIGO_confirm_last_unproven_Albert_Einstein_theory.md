This  <a href="https://morgridge.org/newsarticle/high-throughput-computing-helps-ligo-confirm-einsteins-last-unproven-theory/" data-proofer-ignore>Morgridge Institute news article</a> explains the rich back-story of HTCondor's role behind the recent announcement that scientists from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) unlocked the final door to Einstein's Theory of Relativity. More than 700 LIGO scientists have used HTCondor to run complex data analysis workflows, accumulating 50 million core-hours  in the past six months alone.
