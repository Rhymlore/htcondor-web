The Condor Team is pleased to announce the release of Condor 6.7.6.  It includes support for using the "grid" universe with resources managed by the beta releases of the Globus Toolkit 4.0, the Stork data movement server, and a high-availability daemon to provide backup central managers contributed by Technion - Israel Institute of Technology.  See the <a href="manual/latest-dev/9_Version_History.html"> Version History and Release Notes</a> for details. Condor 6.7.6 is available from our <a href="downloads/">Downloads</a> page.  We believe 6.7.6 is fairly stable, but it is not recommended for production systems, unless you require checkpointing support for a Linux distribution not supported by our 6.6 releases. Users of previous 6.7 versions are urged to upgrade.
