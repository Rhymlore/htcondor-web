A new [mailing list] (Archived Url: 'mail-lists/') for condor users has been added. The Condor Users mailing list is designed to bring the Condor user community together to share ideas, problems, and solutions. It is meant to supplement, but not replace, our existing [support channels] (Archived Url: 'condor-support').
