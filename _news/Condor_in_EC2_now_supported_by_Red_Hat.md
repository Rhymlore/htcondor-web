Red Hat Enterprise MRG support expands into the cloud as announced in this <a href="http://www.redhat.com/about/news/press-archive/2012/2/Red-Hat-Expands-Subscription-Portability-to-the-Cloud-with-Amazon-Web-Services">press release</a>, by leveraging the EC2 job universe in Condor, and by maintaining supported images of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with Condor pre-installed on Amazon storage services.
