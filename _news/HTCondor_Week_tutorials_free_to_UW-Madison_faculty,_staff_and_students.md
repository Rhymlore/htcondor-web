Just a reminder that the [ Tuesday tutorials] (Archived Url: 'https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/HTCondorWeek2016/tuesday.html') at HTCondor Week are free to UW-Madison faculty, staff and students.  If you have any interest in using HTCondor and Center for High Throughput Computing resources, we'd love to see you on Tuesday.  <p>However, as everyone knows, <i>there ain't no such thing as a free lunch</i> -- people who attend the tutorials without paying are not eligible for the lunch (you can still get snacks at the breaks, though).
