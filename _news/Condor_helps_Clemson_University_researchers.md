GRIDtoday reports in the article "<a href="http://www.gridtoday.com/grid/1536201.html">Clemson Researchers Get Boost From Condor</a>" that Clemson University has deployed a campus-wide computing grid built on Condor.  "'The Condor grid has enabled me to conduct my research, without a doubt,' [Assistant Professor] Kurz said. 'Before using the campus grid, I was completely without hope of completing the computational studies that my research required. As soon as I saw hundreds of my jobs running on the campus grid, I started sending love notes to the Condor team at Clemson.'"
