The Condor Team is pleased to announce the release of Condor 7.2.2. This release includes a new full port to Debian 5.0 x86 and a clipped port to Debian 5 x86_64.  Also, it includes a large number of bug fixes in the Hibernation code as well as the SOAP interface, among other systems.  This release has also been made to be forward compatible with the up and coming 7.3 release, when using CCB (which will be detailed in the next 7.3 release). See the <a href="manual/latest-stable/9_Version_History.html">Version History</a> for a complete list of changes.
