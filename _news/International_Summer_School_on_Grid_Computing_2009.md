The International Summer School on Grid Computing 2009, will be in July 2009 in Sophia Antipolis, Nice, France. It's a two-week hands-on summer school course in grid technologies. You'll get a chance to learn a lot of in-depth material not only about various grid technologies, but about the principles that underlie them and connect them together. The school will include talks from well-known grid experts in deploying, using, and developing grids. Hands-on laboratory exercises will give participants experience with widely used grid middleware. <a href="http://www.issgc.org" data-proofer-ignore>More Information</a>
