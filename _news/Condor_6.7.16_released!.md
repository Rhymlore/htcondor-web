The Condor Team is pleased to announce the release of Condor 6.7.16.  This is a bugfix release for 6.7.15.  Together, these two releases include a faster negotiation protocol, a clipped port for PowerPC under YellowDog Linux 3.0, and many other improvements.  See the <a href="manual/latest-dev/9_Version_History.html"> Version History and Release Notes</a> for details. Condor 6.7.16 is available from our <a href="downloads/">Downloads</a> page.  We believe 6.7.16 is fairly stable, but it is not recommended for production systems, unless you require checkpointing support for a Linux distribution not supported by our 6.6 releases.
