The CREAM working group has recently announced official support for the  CREAM-CE will cease in December 2020. We are soliciting  feedback on the HTCondor and Open Science Grid (OSG) transition plan.  Please <a href="https://www-auth.cs.wisc.edu/lists/htcondor-users/2019-February/msg00068.shtml">see this post to the htcondor-users email list</a> for more information, and please email any concerns to htcondor-admin@cs.wisc.edu and/or help@opensciencegrid.org.
