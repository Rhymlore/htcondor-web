This  <a href="http://www.opensciencegrid.org/osg-computational-power-helps-solve-30-year-old-protein-puzzle/" data-proofer-ignore>Open Science Grid news article</a> discusses how the Baker Lab at the University of Washington has used HTCondor and the OSG to successfully simulate the cylindrical TIM-barrel (triosephosphate isomerase-barrel) protein fold, which has been a challenge for nearly 30 years. TIM-barrel protein folds occur widely in enzymes, meaning that understanding them is important for applications such as the development of new vaccines. The Baker Lab performed about 2.4 million core hours of computation on the OSG in 2015.
