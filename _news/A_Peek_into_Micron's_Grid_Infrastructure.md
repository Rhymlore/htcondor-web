In an interview for <em>GRIDtoday</em>, Brooklin Gore discusses Micron's Condor-based grid.  Gore's comments included "We have 11 'pools' (individual grids, all connected via a LAN or WAN) comprising over 11,000 processors at seven sites in four countries. We selected the Condor High Throughput Computing system because it ran on all the platforms we were interested in, met our configuration needs, was widely used and open source yet well supported."
