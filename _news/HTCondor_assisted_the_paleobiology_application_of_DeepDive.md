This  <a href="http://www.news.wisc.edu/23330">UW Madison news article</a> describes the paleobiology application of the DeepDive system, which used text-mining techniques to extract data from publications and build a database. The quality of the database contents equaled that achieved by scientists. HTCondor helped to provide the million hours of compute time needed to build the database from tens of thousands of publications.
