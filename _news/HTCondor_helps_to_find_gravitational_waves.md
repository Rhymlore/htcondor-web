This  <a href="http://www.opensciencegrid.org/osg-helps-ligo-scientists-confirm-einsteins-last-unproven-theory/" data-proofer-ignore>Open Science Grid news article</a> discusses the role of HTCondor, Pegasus and the Open Science Grid in the recently-announced discovery of gravitational waves by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). LIGO used a single HTCondor-based system to run computations across LIGO Data Grid, OSG and Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE)-based resources, and consumed 3,956,910 compute hours on OSG.
