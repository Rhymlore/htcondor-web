"The University of Wisconsin's Condor software project will       provide a component of a cutting-edge grid computing system at European       research heavyweight CERN, the IDG news service reports." "After finding no       commercial grid applications that satisfied all its needs, CERN took to       cobbling together a system from a variety of sources, starting with the       Globus Toolkit from the Globus Alliance and using the Condor project's       scheduling software."
