The Condor Team is pleased to announce the release of Condor 6.7.17.  This release features direct support for running backfill computations on unused nodes, parallel job support in DAGMan, improvements to condor_history, and many other improvements.  See the <a href="manual/latest-dev/9_Version_History.html"> Version History and Release Notes</a> for further details. Condor 6.7.17 is available from our <a href="downloads/">Downloads</a> page.  We believe 6.7.17 is fairly stable, but it is not recommended for production systems, unless you require checkpointing support for a Linux distribution not supported by our 6.6 releases.
