The Hartford Financial Services Group is doing very well with Condor.  See "[Grid Computing At Hartford Life] (Archived Url: 'http://www.loma.org/res-02-05-grid.asp')" by Tammy J. McInturff in the LOMA newsletter." Also, see "[Analyze This] (Archived Url: 'http://www.insurancenetworking.com/protected/article.cfm?articleId=2984&amp;pb=ros')", by Steve Dwyer, (in <em>[Insurance Networking News] (Archived Url: 'http://www.insurancenetworking.com/')</em>) mentions the Hartford Financial Services Group's deployment of Condor.  "'Prior to the grid initiative, we had hit a ceiling with the level of horsepower we could deploy in running calculations through servers and desktops,' says Severino." And, in December 2004, see  "[Mother of Invention ] (Archived Url: 'http://www.insurancetech.com/story/?articleID=55801230')", by Anthony O'Donnell, (in <em>[Insurance &amp; Technology] (Archived Url: 'http://www.insurancetech.com')</em> magazine)  describes the Hartford Financial Services Group's deployment and use of Condor. "The [Condor] grid solution 'is actually more robust,' [CIO Vittorio Severino] says.  'The value is, No. 1, it just creates capacity; No. 2, it's a more stable environment; and then, No. 3, we enjoy the obvious cost savings.'"
