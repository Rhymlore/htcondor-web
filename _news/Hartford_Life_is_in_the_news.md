The Hartford Financial Services Group is doing very well with Condor.  See "<a href="http://www.loma.org/res-02-05-grid.asp" data-proofer-ignore>Grid Computing At Hartford Life</a>" by Tammy J. McInturff in the LOMA newsletter." Also, see "<a href="http://www.insurancenetworking.com/protected/article.cfm?articleId=2984&amp;pb=ros" data-proofer-ignore>Analyze This</a>", by Steve Dwyer, (in <em><a href="http://www.insurancenetworking.com/" data-proofer-ignore>Insurance Networking News</a></em>) mentions the Hartford Financial Services Group's deployment of Condor.  "'Prior to the grid initiative, we had hit a ceiling with the level of horsepower we could deploy in running calculations through servers and desktops,' says Severino." And, in December 2004, see  "<a href="http://www.insurancetech.com/story/?articleID=55801230" data-proofer-ignore>Mother of Invention </a>", by Anthony O'Donnell, (in <em><a href="http://www.insurancetech.com" data-proofer-ignore>Insurance &amp; Technology</a></em> magazine)  describes the Hartford Financial Services Group's deployment and use of Condor. "The [Condor] grid solution 'is actually more robust,' [CIO Vittorio Severino] says.  'The value is, No. 1, it just creates capacity; No. 2, it's a more stable environment; and then, No. 3, we enjoy the obvious cost savings.'"
