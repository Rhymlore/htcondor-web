The Condor Team is pleased to announce the release of Condor 7.0.4. This release fixes a problem with DENY lists in the authorization policy that could allow access when it should be denied. Additional changes include guarding against administrative tools cleaning up in-use files in the system's temporary directory and improving memory usage in the collector. Bugs fixed on Windows include daemons failing to start and crashes related to Condor-C and parallel jobs. See the <a href="manual/latest-stable/9_Version_History.html">version history</a> for a complete list of bugs that have been fixed. Condor 7.0.4 binaries and source code are available from <a href="downloads/">our downloads page</a>.
