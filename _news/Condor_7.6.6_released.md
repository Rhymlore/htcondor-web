The Condor team is pleased to announce the newest release in our stable series, 7.6.6.  This release fixes several important bugs in 7.6.5 and earlier versions of Condor, including a problem which would cause the schedd to abort, a problem which prevented the checkpoint server from running on RHEL 6, and a memory leak in the schedd. Please see the <a href="manual/latest-stable/9_Version_History.html">release notes</a> for a complete list.  Condor binaries and source code are available from <a href="downloads/">our Downloads page.</a>
