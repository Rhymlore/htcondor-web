Condor Version 6.3.0 has been released, and is available on the <a href="downloads/"> downloads</a> page. 6.3.0 is the first release in the 6.3 <i>development</i> series. Future 6.3 releases will contain many new features, primarily in the areas of MPI support, Globus support,  firewall support, an improved DAGMan, improved error handling / propagation, and bandwidth regulation.  For more info on our version-number system, please read <a href="version_number.html">this</a>. <p> The UNIX builds are now available on the website. The primary focus of 6.3.0 has been in preliminary support for MPI jobs on dedicated clusters of  machines. 6.3.0 is not as well-tested as 6.2.0, and undoubtedly contains a number of bugs. It should not be used by those requiring a tried and tested system; for that we recommend the 6.2 stable series.
