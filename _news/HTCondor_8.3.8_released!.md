The HTCondor team is pleased to announce the release of HTCondor 8.3.8. This development series release contains new features that are under development. This release contains all of the bug fixes from the 8.2.9 stable release.  Enhancements in the release include: a script to tune Linux kernel parameters for better scalability; support for python bindings on Windows platforms; a mechanism to remove Docker images from the local machine.  Static analysis tools were used to identify and fix memory leaks and other code deficiencies.
