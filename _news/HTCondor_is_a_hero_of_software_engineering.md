as reported by Ian Cottam in his <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2013-09-30-heroes-software-engineering-miron-livny-and-htcondor">blog for the Software Sustainability Institute at the University of Manchester</a>. Ian appreciates that HTCondor is easy to install, runs on many platforms, and contains features such as DAGMan to order the execution of sets of jobs, making the system even more useful.
