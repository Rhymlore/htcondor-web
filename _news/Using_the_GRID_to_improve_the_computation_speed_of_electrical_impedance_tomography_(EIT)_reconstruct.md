Authors Fritschy, Horesh, Holder, and Bayford presents an       improvement to image quality generation (using Condor),       that make clinical use of the images more practical.  "Using the GRID middleware "Condor" and a cluster of 920 nodes, reconstruction of EIT images of the human head with a non-linear algorithm was speeded up by 25-40 times compared to serial processing of each image."
