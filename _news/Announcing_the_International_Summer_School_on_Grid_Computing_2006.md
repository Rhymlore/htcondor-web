If you are interested in learning about grid technology (including Condor) from leading authorities in the field, we encourage you to investigate the [International Summer School on Grid Computing] (Archived Url: 'http://www.dma.unina.it/~murli/ISSGC06/'). The School will include lectures on the principles, technologies, experience and exploitation of Grids. Lectures will also review the research horizon and report recent significant successes. Lectures will be given in the mornings. In the afternoons the practical exercises will take place on the equipment installed at the School site in Ischia, Italy (near Naples).  The work will be challenging but rewarding.
