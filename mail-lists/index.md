<H2>HTCondor Users</H2>
<p>
The HTCondor-users list is meant to be a forum for HTCondor users to learn from
each other and discuss using HTCondor. It is an excellent place to ask questions 
about using and configuring HTCondor from the user community.
Our <a href="http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/htcondor-support/">support pages</a> 
have more information about additional support channels if this forum does not
adequately answer your questions.
<P>
Please do not post the same issue to htcondor-users
and htcondor-admin at the same time.</p>

<H2>HTCondor Developers</H2>
<p>
The htcondor-devel list is meant to be a forum for people developing
HTCondor to learn from each other and discuss their experiences.
It is not meant to be the official support channel for HTCondor.
Our <a href="http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/htcondor-support/">support pages</a> 
have more information about the offical support channels.
<P>
The HTCondor team will attempt to monitor the htcondor-devel list and respond to
as much as we can, but htcondor-admin@cs.wisc.edu remains the main support
address for HTCondor issues. Please do not post the same issue to
htcondor-devel
and htcondor-admin at the same time.</p>
