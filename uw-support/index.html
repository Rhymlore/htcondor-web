    <b>
        Internal contract support enjoys guaranteed problem resolution and faster turn-around times.
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    Because many institutions utilize HTCSS as a production-level service, they
    have requested a more formal mechanism for support. As a result, contracted
    support is available.
</p>
<b>Benefits of Internal Contract Support:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Guaranteed Problem Resolution</li>
    <li>Faster Issue Turn-Around</li>
    <li>Telephone Access</li>
    <li>Priority Email Access</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The HTCondor Maintenance Agreement describes the several
    different support policies that are available, as well as  the
    fees associated with each policy.
