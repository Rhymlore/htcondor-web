            HTCondor is a software system that creates a High-Throughput Computing (HTC) environment. It
            effectively uses the computing power of machines connected over a network, be they a single
            cluster, a set of clusters on a campus, cloud resources either standalone or temporarily
            joined to a local cluster, or international grids. Power comes from the ability to effectively
            harness shared resources with distributed ownership.
