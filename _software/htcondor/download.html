            Long Term Support (LTS) releases only bug fixes to a particular, fixed set of
            features from the current LTS channel.  As a result, each LTS channel tends to
            become more stable over time; read the <a href="https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/version-history/">release notes</a>
            from the current channel to make sure you aren't missing any features you
            need.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you can't regularly upgrade your machines, this may be the channel
            for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Periodically, we will update the set of features that we support with
            bug fixes and start a new LTS channel.  This will not the change the set
            of features available to an existing or automatically-updated installation of
            a LTS channel; you have to make the decision to change manually.  However,
            after a time, we will stop issuing additional bug fixes for older LTS
            channels.
