<h3>Long Term Support (LTS) Channel</h3>
<div class="mb-4 p-2 bg-light">
    <h5>Channel Details</h5>
    <p>The Long Term Support channels distribute only bug fixes to a particular, fixed set of
        features from the current channel.  As a result, each LTS channel tends to
        become more stable over time; read the <a href="https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/version-history/">release notes</a>
        from the current channel to make sure you aren't missing any features you
        need.</p>
    <p>If you can't regularly upgrade your machines, this may be the channel
        for you.</p>
    <p>Periodically, we will update the set of features that we support with
        bug fixes and start a new LTS channel.  This will not the change the set
        of features available to an existing or automatically-updated installation of
        a LTS channel; you have to make the decision to change manually.  However,
        after a time, we will stop issuing additional bug fixes for older LTS
        channels.</p>
    <p>The following link always goes to the instructions for the newest LTS
        channel.</p>
    <p>In this channel, the second number in the HTCondor version will be 0 (9.<b>0</b>.<b>Y</b>).</p>
