title: Bringing Your Own Resources
---

You can bring your own resources to an OS Pool access point.  This can be more
convenient than taking your jobs to those resources.

#### Bringing an XSEDE (XRAC) Allocation to the OS Pool

If you have an XSEDE (XRAC) Allocation for time on the Anvil, Stampede 2,
Bridge 2, or Expanse systems, you can use the `htcondor` command line
tool on `login04.osgconnect.net` or `login05.osgconnect.net` to run
jobs there.  You'll need an account from the
[XSEDE User Portal](https://portal.xsede.org) to get started, as well
as a job that will run one of the listed systems.  (You can
download an [example job](example_job) for testing.)

Follow the recipe to run a job on:
- [Stampede 2](stampede2)
- [Bridges 2](bridges2)
- [Expanse](expanse)
- [Anvil](anvil)
