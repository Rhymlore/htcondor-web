        <h3>Long Term Support (LTS) Channels</h3>

        <p>The Long Term Support channels distribute only bug fixes to a particular, fixed set of
        features from the current channel.  As a result, each LTS channel tends to
        become more stable over time; read the <a href="https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/version-history/">release notes</a>
        from the current channel to make sure you aren't missing any features you
        need.</p>
        <p>If you can't regularly upgrade your machines, this may be the channel
        for you.</p>
        <p>Periodically, we will update the set of features that we support with
        bug fixes and start a new LTS channel.  This will not the change the set
        of features available to an existing or automatically-updated installation of
        a LTS channel; you have to make the decision to change manually.  However,
        after a time, we will stop issuing additional bug fixes for older LTS
        channels.</p>
        <p>The following link always goes to the instructions for the newest LTS
        channel.</p>
