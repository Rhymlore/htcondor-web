  The Condor Team is pleased to announce the release of Condor 6.7.14.  Highlights
  include grid universe support for NorduGrid and Unicore, system job policy expressions,
  and job start time deferral. Users of prior version of 6.7.x are encouraged to upgrade.  See
  the  Version History and Release Notes for details. Condor 6.7.14 is available from
  our Downloads page.  We believe 6.7.14 is fairly stable, but it is not recommended
  for production systems, unless you require checkpointing support for a Linux distribution
  not supported by our 6.6 releases.
