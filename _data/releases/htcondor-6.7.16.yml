  The Condor Team is pleased to announce the release of Condor 6.7.16.  This is a
  bugfix release for 6.7.15.  Together, these two releases include a faster negotiation
  protocol, a clipped port for PowerPC under YellowDog Linux 3.0, and many other improvements.  See
  the  Version History and Release Notes for details. Condor 6.7.16 is available from
  our Downloads page.  We believe 6.7.16 is fairly stable, but it is not recommended
  for production systems, unless you require checkpointing support for a Linux distribution
  not supported by our 6.6 releases.
