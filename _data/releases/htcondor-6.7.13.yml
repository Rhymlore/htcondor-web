  The Condor Team is pleased to announce the release of Condor 6.7.13.  Highlights
  include Generic Connection Brokering for traversing firewalls and private networks,
  Quill on Windows, and a new clipped port for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 on IA64.
  Users of prior version of 6.7.x are encouraged to upgrade.  See the <a href="manual/latest-dev/9_Version_History.html">
  Version History and Release Notes</a> for details. Condor 6.7.13 is available from
  our Downloads page.  We believe 6.7.13 is fairly stable,
  but it is not recommended for production systems, unless you require checkpointing
  support for a Linux distribution not supported by our 6.6 releases.
