content: "\nThe Condor Team is pleased to announce the release of Condor 7.5.3. This\
  \ is a development release of Condor. Please note that we dropped our old repackaged\
  \ tarball rpms, and now only provide the proper rpm and debian packages introduced\
  \ in version 7.5.1. Therefore you will see fewer downloads offered for 7.5.3 compared\
  \ to 7.5.2. See the <a href=\"manual/latest-dev/9_Version_History.html\">Version\
  \ History</a> for a complete list of changes.  Condor 7.5.3 binaries and source\
  \ code are available from <a href=\"downloads/\">our Downloads page.</a> \n"
