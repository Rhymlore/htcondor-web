  Condor 6.1.6 is now available for download. Version 6.1.6 fixes many serious bugs
  from 6.1.5. In addition, it provides many new features, including the ability to
  dynamically reconfigure the number of virtual machines reported by the SMP startd,
  SMP support for Digital Unix machines and much more. There are still some unresolved
  problems with Linux running Red Hat 5.2 (LINUX-GLIBC).  This platform is not supported
  in 6.1.6.  A 6.1.7 release will follow very soon, which will support Red Hat 5.2.
  Red Hat 6.0 is NOT SUPPORTED by Condor yet.  It uses the new 2.2.X Linux kernel,
  which is not supported at this time. <font color="#ff0000"> Like all development
  releases, this release is INCOMPATIBLE with previous versions of Condor.  DO NOT
  TRY TO USE IT IN A POOL WITH ANY 6.1.5 DAEMONS.  </font> For complete details, you
  can read about what''s new in this version.
