  The Condor Team is pleased to announce the release of Condor 6.7.10.  This version
  is primarily for bug fixes, including a number of serious bugs the Windows port.  Many
  of the bugs were recently introduced in the 6.7 development series, so users of
  the 6.6 stable series need not upgrade.  Users of prior versions of 6.7.x are urged
  to upgrade.  See the  Version History and Release Notes for details. Condor 6.7.10
  is available from our Downloads page.  We believe 6.7.10 is fairly stable, but it
  is not recommended for production systems, unless you require checkpointing support
  for a Linux distribution not supported by our 6.6 releases.
