content: "\nThe HTCondor team is pleased to announce the release of HTCondor 8.3.4.\
  \ This development release contains a single bug fix for a problem introduced in\
  \ version 8.3.3 that can cause jobs to not be matched to resources when the condor_schedd\
  \ is flocking. This 8.3.4 release also has a known issue which prevents a mixed\
  \ mode, IPv4 and IPv6 HTCondor installation from starting jobs. If using IPv4 and\
  \ IPv6 in mixed mode communication is required, please continue using HTCondor version\
  \ 8.3.2. The issue will be fixed in version 8.3.5. Further details can be found\
  \ in the <a href=\"manual/v8.3.4/10_3Development_Release.html\">Version History</a>.\
  \ HTCondor 8.3.4 binaries and source code are available from our <a href=\"downloads/\"\
  >Downloads</a> page. \n"
