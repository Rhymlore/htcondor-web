  The Condor Team is pleased to announce the release of Condor 6.7.20.  This release
  features many bugfixes and new features, including a variety of built-in functions
  that can be used in ClassAds and a unified mapfile providing more flexible identity
  management when using strong authentication.  See the <a href="manual/latest-dev/9_Version_History.html">
  Version History and Release Notes</a> for further details. Condor 6.7.20 is available
  from our Downloads page.  We believe 6.7.20 is fairly
  stable, but it is not recommended for production systems, unless you require checkpointing
  support for a Linux distribution not supported by our 6.6 releases.
