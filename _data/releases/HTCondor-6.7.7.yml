  The Condor Team is pleased to announce the release of Condor 6.7.7.  6.7.7 is primarily
  for improvements to the grid universe.  It includes support for strong authentication
  and multiple users for the "condor" gridtype, and full support for the Globus Toolkit
  4.0.0 release.  See the <a href="manual/latest-dev/9_Version_History.html"> Version
  History and Release Notes</a> for details. Condor 6.7.7 is available from our <a
  href="downloads/">Downloads</a> page.  We believe 6.7.7 is fairly stable, but it
  is not recommended for production systems, unless you require checkpointing support
  for a Linux distribution not supported by our 6.6 releases.  6.7.6 users who are
  using the Globus Toolkit 4.0 are strongly urged to upgrade to 6.7.7.
