content: "\nThe Condor Team is pleased to announce the release of Condor 7.1.0 (not\
  \ to be confused with our recent stable series release 7.0.1). This development\
  \ series release introduces several new features.  The condor_startd can be configured\
  \ to fetch jobs from other sources using a simple plug-in mechanism.  A new daemon\
  \ condor_job_router has been added for dynamically transforming suitable Vanilla\
  \ Universe jobs into Grid Universe jobs.  DAGMan's handling of rescue DAGs has been\
  \ improved to better support nested DAGs.  DAGIrl has been added to better support\
  \ Irl workflows in the beginning of April.  See the <a href=\"manual/latest-dev/9_Version_History.html\"\
  >Version History</a> for a complete list of changes.  Condor 7.1.0 binaries and\
  \ source code are available from <a href=\"downloads/\">our Downloads page</a>.\
