content: "\nThe HTCondor team is pleased to announce the release of HTCondor 8.5.1.\
  \ This development series release contains new features that are under development.\
  \ This release contains all of the bug fixes from the 8.4.3 stable release.  Enhancements\
  \ in the release include: the shared port daemon is enabled by default; the condor_startd\
  \ now records the peak memory usage instead of recent; the condor_startd advertises\
  \ CPU submodel and cache size; authorizations are automatically setup when \"Match\
  \ Password\" is enabled; added a schedd-constraint option to condor_q.  With the\
  \ shared port daemon enabled, all HTCondor daemons share a single inbound network\
  \ port. This change makes it much easier to construct a firewall configuration that\
  \ allows HTCondor use.  Further details can be found in the <a href=\"manual/v8.5.1/10_2Development_Release.html\"\
  >Version History</a>. HTCondor 8.5.1 binaries and source code are available from\
  \ our <a href=\"downloads/\">Downloads</a> page. \n"
