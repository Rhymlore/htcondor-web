  After two years of development, this is the first release of the new stable series.
  It includes all the enhancements and bug fixes in the 8.9 series. Many of these
  changes have focused on improving the security of HTCondor and improving the utility
  of the file transfer plugins.

  Highlights of this release are:
  - Absent any configuration, a new HTCondor installation denies authorization to all user
  - AES encryption is used for all communication and file transfers by default (Hardware accelerated when available)
  - New IDTOKEN authentication method enables fine-grained authorization control designed to replace GSI authentication
  - Improved support for GPUs, including machines with multiple GPUs
  - New condor_watch_q tool that efficiently provides live job status updates
  - Many improvements to the Python bindings, including new bindings for DAGMan and chirp
  - Improved curl, https, box, Amazon S3, and google drive file transfer plugins supporting uploads and authentication
  - File transfer times are now recorded in the job log
  - Added support for jobs that need to acquire and use OAUTH tokens
  - Many memory footprint and performance improvements in DAGMan
  - Submitter ceilings allow administrators to set limits on the number of running jobs per user across the pool.
