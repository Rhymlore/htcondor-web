content: "\nThe Condor team is pleased to announce the release of Condor 7.7.1.  This\
  \ is the second release in the development series.  This release of Condor now dynamically\
  \ links the executables to the system security libraries, including openssl.  In\
  \ the past, these libraries have been statically linked into the binaries.  As a\
  \ result, system security updates will immediately benefit Condor.  The downside\
  \ is that binaries built for a given platform may not be as portable to other platforms\
  \ as in the past.  We have also seen a very rare, intermittent problem with DAGMan\
  \ where the DAGMan program will ignore a successful job completion, and wait forever.\
  \  We hope to resolve this problem in the next development release.  The Version\
  \ History  has a list of the major changes.  Condor binaries and source code are\
  \ available  from our Downloads page. \n"
