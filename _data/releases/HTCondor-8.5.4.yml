  \ This development series release contains new features that are under development.\
  \ This release contains all of the bug fixes from the 8.4.6 stable release. For\
  \ sites using partitionable slots, one of the fixes from the 8.4.6 release corrects\
  \ a serious regression in version 8.5.3.  Highlights of the release are: Fixed a\
  \ bug that delays schedd response when significant attributes change; Fixed a bug\
  \ where the group ID was not set in Docker universe jobs; Limit update rate of various\
  \ attributes to not overload the collector; To make job router configuration easier,\
  \ added implicit \"target\" scoping; To make BOSCO work, the blahp does not generate\
  \ limited proxies by default; condor_status can now display utilization per machine\
  \ rather than per slot; Improve performance of condor_history and other tools. \
  \ Further details can be found in the <a href=\"manual/v8.5.4/10_2Development_Release.html\"\
  >Version History</a>. HTCondor 8.5.4 binaries and source code are available from\
  \ our <a href=\"downloads/\">Downloads</a> page. \n"
