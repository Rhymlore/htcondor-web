  The Condor Team is pleased to announce the release of Condor 6.7.18.  This release
  features important security fixes and many other improvements.  See the <a href="manual/latest-dev/9_Version_History.html">
  Version History and Release Notes</a> for further details. Condor 6.7.18 is available
  from our <a href="downloads/">Downloads</a> page.  We strongly recommend sites running
  earlier versions of Condor in the 6.7 development series upgrade to 6.7.18 as soon
  as feasible.  We believe 6.7.18 is fairly stable, but it is not recommended for
  production systems, unless you require checkpointing support for a Linux distribution
  not supported by our 6.6 releases.
