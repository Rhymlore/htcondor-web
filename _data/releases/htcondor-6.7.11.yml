  The Condor Team is pleased to announce the release of Condor 6.7.11.  This version
  is primarily for Quill.  Quill maintains a read-only mirror of the job queue in
  a database, enabling faster and more powerful queries as well as reducing the load
  on the schedd.  In addition, there were a number of bug fixes.  See the  Version
  History and Release Notes for details.  Condor 6.7.11 contained several critical
  bugs and was pulled from the mirror site.  Interested users should try 6.7.12 instead.
