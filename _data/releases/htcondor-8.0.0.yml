content: "\nThe HTCondor team is pleased to announce the release of HTCondor 8.0.0.\
  \ This release is the first in the new stable series. The major version number changed\
  \ because of the project rename to HTCondor and not because of major incompatibility\
  \ with the version 7.8 stable series. This new version contains Bosco, support for\
  \ EC2 Spot instances, interactive jobs, improved job sandboxing, native python API\
  \ and several new tools. A complete list of bugs fixed and features can be found\
  \ in the  Version History. HTCondor 8.0.0 binaries and source code are available\
  \ from our Downloads page. \n"
