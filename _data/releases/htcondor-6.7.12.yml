  The Condor Team is pleased to announce the release of Condor 6.7.12.  This version
  is being released to fix several critical bugs in Condor 6.7.11.  6.7.11 was not
  widely advertised, but was available on our mirror site for a short period.  Any
  users of 6.7.11, or any other prior version of 6.7.x are urged to upgrade.  See
  the  Version History and Release Notes for details. Condor 6.7.12 is available from
  our Downloads page.  We believe 6.7.12 is fairly stable, but it is not recommended
  for production systems, unless you require checkpointing support for a Linux distribution
  not supported by our 6.6 releases.
