  The Condor Team is pleased to announce the release of Condor 6.7.17.  This release
  features direct support for running backfill computations on unused nodes, parallel
  job support in DAGMan, improvements to condor_history, and many other improvements.  See
  the  Version History and Release Notes for further details. Condor 6.7.17 is available
  from our Downloads page.  We believe 6.7.17 is fairly stable, but it is not recommended
  for production systems, unless you require checkpointing support for a Linux distribution
  not supported by our 6.6 releases.
