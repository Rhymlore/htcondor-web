  The Condor Team is pleased to announce the release of Condor 6.7.8.  6.7.8 is primarily
  for bug fixes, but includes some scalability additions for DAGMan and the Standard
  Universe.  See the  Version History and Release Notes for details. Condor 6.7.8
  is available from our Downloads page.  We believe 6.7.8 is fairly stable, but it
  is not recommended for production systems, unless you require checkpointing support
  for a Linux distribution not supported by our 6.6 releases.
