  The Condor Team is pleased to announce the release of Condor 6.7.5.  6.7.5 is the
  fifth release of our development series, and is primarily a new feature release.
  Condor 6.7.5 includes the SOAP interface to some Condor daemons, a option to DAGMan
  to abort a DAG when a node fails with a specific error code, enhancements to the
  MPI universe in scheduling and requirements, and speed-ups in claiming large number
  of machines. See the <a href="manual/latest-dev/9_Version_History.html"> Version
  History and Release Notes</a> for details. Condor 6.7.5 is available from our Downloads
  page. We believe 6.7.5 is fairly stable, but it is not recommended for production
  systems, unless you require checkpointing support for a Linux distribution not supported
  by our 6.6 releases. Users of previous 6.7 versions are urged to upgrade.
