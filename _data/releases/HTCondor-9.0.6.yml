  The HTCondor Team is pleased to announce the HTCondor 9.0.6 LTS release.

  A Long Term Support (LTS) release contains significant bug fixes.


  Highlights of this release are:

  - CUDA\_VISIBLE\_DEVICES can now contain GPU-<uuid> formatted values

  - Fixed a bug that caused jobs to fail when using newer Singularity versions

  - Fixed a bug in the Windows MSI installer for the latest Windows 10 version

  - Fixed bugs relating to the transfer of standard out and error logs

  - MacOS 11.x now reports as 10.16.x (which is better than reporting x.0)
