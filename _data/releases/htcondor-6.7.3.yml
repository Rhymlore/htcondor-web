  6.7.3 is the fourth release of our development series. 6.7.3 is primarily a new
  feature release. 6.7.3 is the first release to fully support  checkpointing on Linux
  distributions Fedora Core 1, 2, and 3.   6.7.3 also includes preliminary support
  for a new remote submission feature that will complement flocking and the grid universe.
  See the  Version History and Release Notes for details. Condor 6.7.3 is available
  from our  Downloads page. We believe 6.7.3 is fairly stable, but it is not recommended  for
  production systems, unless you require checkpointing support for a  Linux distribution
  not supported by our 6.6 releases. Users of previous  6.7 versions are urged to
  upgrade.
