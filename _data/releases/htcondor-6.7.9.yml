  The Condor Team is pleased to announce the release of Condor 6.7.9.  This version
  is primarily for the new parallel universe, but also includes many bug fixes and
  improvements to Condor-C.  See the  Version History and Release Notes for details.
  Condor 6.7.9 is available from our Downloads page.  We believe 6.7.9 is fairly stable,
  but it is not recommended for production systems, unless you require checkpointing
  support for a Linux distribution not supported by our 6.6 releases.
