  6.6.4 and 6.6.3 are the latest version of our current stable release series. 6.6.4
  is for MacOS X and Windows only, and is otherwise identical to 6.6.3.  6.6.3 includes
  support for Globus 3.2, and removes support for Globus releases prior to 2.2.  If
  you are not using  the Globus universe, there is very little difference between
  6.6.2 and 6.6.3. See the  Version History and Release Notes for details. Condor
  6.6 is available from our Downloads page.
