  Condor Version 6.3.0 has been released, and is available on the <a href="downloads/">
  downloads</a> page. 6.3.0 is the first release in the 6.3 <i>development</i> series.
  Future 6.3 releases will contain many new features, primarily in the areas of MPI
  support, Globus support,  firewall support, an improved DAGMan, improved error handling
  / propagation, and bandwidth regulation.  For more info on our version-number system,
  please read this. <p> The UNIX builds are now
  available on the website. The primary focus of 6.3.0 has been in preliminary support
  for MPI jobs on dedicated clusters of  machines. 6.3.0 is not as well-tested as
  6.2.0, and undoubtedly contains a number of bugs. It should not be used by those
  requiring a tried and tested system; for that we recommend the 6.2 stable series.
