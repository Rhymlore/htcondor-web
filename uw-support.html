<h1>Contracted Support for HTCondor from the HTCondor Team</h1>

<p>Contracted support for HTCondor is available directly from the developers, the
    HTCondor Team at UW-Madison. </p>


<p>Because many institutions utilize HTCondor as a production-level service, they
    have requested a more formal mechanism for support. As a result, contracted
    support is available. Organizations that pay for a support contract enjoy
    guaranteed problem resolution and faster turn-around times, as well as
    telephone access (in addition to email). With a support contract in place, you
    can send email to our high-priority email address, which is <a href="mailto:htcondor-support@cs.wisc.edu">htcondor-support@cs.wisc.edu</a>,
    instead of to htcondor-admin@cs.wisc.edu. </p>

<p>The HTCondor Maintenance Agreement describes the several
    different support policies that are available, as well as  the
    fees associated with each policy.
    For further information, please email
    <a href="mailto:htcondor-support@cs.wisc.edu">htcondor-support@cs.wisc.edu</a>.
    The Agreement is in the following file formats: </p>

<ul>
    <li> <a href="{{ '/uw-support/support-agreement.odt' | relative_url }}">.odt Word format</a> </li>
    <li><a href="{{ '/uw-support/support-agreement.pdf' | relative_url }}">PDF (Adobe Acrobat)</a> </li>
